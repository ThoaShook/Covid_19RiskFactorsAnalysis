##### Covid_19RiskFactorsAnalysis
##### Objective:
* From my previous Coronavirus-Analysis task, I have concluded that people of all ages can be infected by Covid-19.However, Covid-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe illness. In this study, I hope that by using available data and cross referencing with published work on other coronavirus outbreaks, we can infer what risk factors may be present. 
* I also hope to advance the techniques developed here to refine understanding of the needs and create a tool capable of aiding researchers in their quest to understand and act against COVID-19.
