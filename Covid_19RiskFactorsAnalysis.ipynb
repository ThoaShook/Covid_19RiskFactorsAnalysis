       "Since its first appearance in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has affected more than 25 countries in four continents, with more than 1300 cases and a frightening fatality rate of greater than 30%. 1 A novel lineage C betacoronavirus the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been confirmed to be the etiological agent. 2,3 The subsequent detection of MERS-CoV and its antibodies in dromedaries in various countries in the Middle East has led to the hypothesis that these animals may be the reservoir for MERS-CoV. 4-13 Furthermore, the discovery of other closely related lineage C betacoronaviruses both before and after the beginning of the MERS epidemic in various bat species and hedgehogs, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] as well as the demonstration of the ability of the spike protein of Tylonecteris bat CoV HKU4 to bind to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor of MERS-CoV, have also suggested that these animals may be the hosts for the ancestor of MERS-CoV. [19] [20] [21] [22] Although MERS-CoV can be cultured and antibody detection methods are available, laboratory diagnosis and epidemiology studies of MERS-CoV infections are mainly achieved by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time qRT-PCR), using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the region upstream of the envelope gene or the nucleocapsid (N) gene of MERS-CoV as the target. 1,23-27 However, the cost of real-time qRT-PCR is still high and such expertise may not be available, particularly in some clinical microbiology laboratories in the Middle East where most of the cases were identified. Because enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antigen detection offers an inexpensive and user-friendly approach for laboratory diagnosis and epidemiological studies of respiratory viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, 28, 29 we recently developed a monoclonal antibodybased capture ELISA for the detection of MERS-CoV N protein. 30 In this study, we describe the application of N protein ELISA, real-time qRT-PCR, isothermal amplification, virus isolation, and antibody detection in a cross-sectional epidemiological study of a dromedary dairy herd in Dubai after sudden death and the detection of MERS-CoV from a dromedary calf within the herd. The 1-month-old female dromedary calf with sudden death belonged to a closed dairy herd reared for milk production, which roamed a small desert area in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. In addition to the calf that succumbed, samples were collected from the remaining 254 dromedaries in the herd, comprising 133 adult female dromedaries and 121 dromedary calves. There were no adult male dromedaries in the herd and mating was human-assisted. Capture ELISA for detection of MERS-CoV N protein MERS-CoV N protein ELISA on nasal swabs was performed as previously described. 30 Briefly, microplates (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were pre-coated with the first anti-MERS-CoV-recombinant N protein monoclonal antibody 1F6 and incubated at 37 6 C overnight with a blocking reagent (phosphate-buffered saline with 2% sucrose, 0.2% casein-Na, and 2% gelatin). Fifty microliters of viral lysis buffer was added to each coated well and 50 mL of each nasal sample was then added to the wells in duplicate. The plate was shaken for 2 min and incubated at 37 6 C for 30 min. After the wells were washed five times, 100 mL of the second anti-MERS-CoV-recombinant N protein monoclonal antibody 7C4 conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was added and the plate was incubated at 37 6 C for 30 min. After five washes, detection was carried out by adding 100 mL of tetramethylbenzidine per well, incubating the samples for 10 min, and adding 50 mL of 0.2 M H 2 SO 4 . The optical density (OD) 450/630 nm was measured with a microplate reader. Real-time qRT-PCR screening assay MERS-CoV nucleic acid detection on the nasal swabs and milk was performed using a real-time qRT-PCR assay targeting the region upstream of the envelope gene and by isothermal amplification using a Genie instrument (OptiGene Limited, Horsham, UK). For real-time qRT-PCR assays, a 25-mL reaction was set up containing 5 ml of RNA, 12.5 mL of 23 reaction buffer provided with the Superscript III onestep RT-PCR system with Invitrogen Platinum Taq Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA); containing 0.4 mM of each dNTP and 3.2 mM magnesium sulfate), 1 mL of reverse transcriptase/Taq mixture from the kit, 0.4 mL of a 50 mM magnesium sulfate solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), 1 mg of non-acetylated bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), 400 nM concentrations of primer upE-Fwd (GCA ACG CGC GAT TCA GTT) and primer upE-Rev (GCC TCT ACA CGG GAC CCA TA), as well as a 200 nM concentration of probe upE-Prb (6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM))-CTC TTC ACA TAA TCG CCC CGA GCT CG-6-carboxy-N,N,N,N9 -tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)). The thermal cycling protocol was 55 6 C for 20 min, followed by 95 6 C for 3 min and then 45 cycles of 95 6 C for 15 s and 58 6 C for 30 s. Viral culture MERS-CoV isolates from nasal swabs were grown on African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. 2,31,32 Samples were inoculated in Vero cells at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 for 1 h. Unattached viruses were removed by washing the cells twice in serum-free Gibco minimum essential medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The monolayer cells were maintained in minimum essential medium with 1% fetal calf serum. All infected cell lines were incubated at 37 6 C for 5 days. Cytopathic effects were examined on days 1, 3, and 5 by inverted light microscopy. All serum samples were tested for MERS-CoV IgG antibodies using Euroimmun ELISA (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany). Samples were applied at a 1:101 dilution and incubated in the wells of microtiter strips coated with the purified spike protein subdomain S1 antigen of MERS-CoV. A ratio of .1.0 was considered to be positive. The complete genome of the MERS-CoV isolate was amplified and sequenced as described previously. [33] [34] [35] [36] RNA extracted from a nasal specimen was used as the template. Sequences were assembled and edited to produce final sequences. For phylogenetic analysis, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with 1000 bootstraps was constructed using PhyML v3.0, based on complete concatenated coding sequences of 68 available human MERS-CoV and 18 camel MERS-CoV genomes. A general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution with estimated base frequencies, a proportion of invariant sites, and a gamma distribution of rates across sites was applied to conduct maximum likelihood analysis. The nucleotide sequences of the genomes and the deduced amino acid sequences of the MERS-CoV sequenced in this study were compared to 68 available human MERS-CoV and 18 camel MERS-CoV genomes. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of each coding sequence were aligned using MAFFT version 7. 37 Unique mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions at the coding sequences were revealed. The nucleotide sequence of the genome of the camel MERS-CoV in this study has been submitted to the GenBank sequence database under accession NO KT751244.  Necropsy, capture ELISA for detection of the MERS-CoV N protein, real-time qRT-PCR screening assay and viral culture Necropsy of the dromedary calf with sudden death showed that the cause of death was cryptosporidiosis and colisepticemia. The nasal sample, but not trachea, lung, and tonsil samples collected from the dromedary calf were positive for the N protein (OD 3.712, OD of negative control 0.065), real-time qRT-PCR, and virus isolation. In contrast, the nasal swabs of the other 254 dromedaries as well as the milk produced by the 133 female adult dromedaries were all negative for the N protein, real-time qRT-PCR, and virus isolation. MERS-CoV IgG was positive in the sera of 132 (99%) adult dromedaries and 102 (84%) dromedary calves. This IgG positivity showed a gradual increase in dromedary calves with increasing age, with positivity rates of 75% in dromedary calves of age 0-3 months, 79% at 4 months, 89% at 5-6 months, and 90% at 7-12 months (Figure 1 ). Complete genome sequencing of the MERS-CoV isolated from the nasal swab of the dromedary calf with sudden death, as well as phylogenetic analysis, showed that this MERS-CoV strain did not cluster with the other MERS-CoV strains from Dubai that we reported recently (Figure 2 ). 38 Unique mutations in the genome Using the available complete genomes of MERS-CoV as references, non-synonymous mutations, resulting in 11 unique amino acid differences, were observed between the MERS-CoV genome from the present study and all the other available MERS-CoV genomes ( Figure 3 ). Among these 11 unique amino acid differences, four were found in ORF1ab (E1059D, P1951L, P2269S, and M6117I), three were found in the S1 domain of the spike protein (S28P, S459T, and P710S), and one each was found the proteins encoded by ORF4b, ORF5, the envelope gene and ORF8. We report the first cross-sectional epidemiology study of MERS-CoV in a closed dromedary dairy herd using antigen, nucleic acid, and antibody detection and virus isolation. Similarly to results from previous reports, MERS-CoV was detected in a dromedary calf. 39, 40 This dromedary calf with MERS-CoV did not show any respiratory clinical signs and had died of cryptosporidiosis and colisepticemia. This is in line with our observation that other dromedary calves with sudden death and MERS-CoV detected have also died of various diseases, such as salmonellosis, clostridial enterotoxemia, and isoporiosis instead of pneumonia, and MERS-CoV was detected in the animals only incidentally (unpublished data). Notably, the MERS-CoV strain isolated in the present study clustered with other patient strains from east Saudi Arabia and Qatar, including the one from a Korean patient who acquired infection in this area. This is in contrast to the MERS-CoV strains reported in our previous study in Dubai, 38 which formed another cluster not closely related to the present strain. This indicated that more than one strain of MERS-CoV is circulating in Dubai. Notably, among the three amino acid changes located at the S1 domain of the spike protein as a result of non-synonymous mutations, none are located at the receptor-binding subdomain, suggesting that the camel MERS-CoV is still likely to bind human receptor DPP4. The significance of these mutations is unclear and needs to be investigated further. The dromedaries in this study belonged to a closed herd that did not have contact with other herds because they were browsing in a confined area. It is believed that the virus could be circulating in the herd, which was probably infected in Saudi Arabia several years ago when the dams were calves. Alternatively, the deceased calf may have been infected from an unknown external source. The present data showed increasing sero-positivity with advancing age in dromedary calves. It has been reported that the prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies is significantly higher in dromedary adults than in calves. 4, 5, [9] [10] [11] [12] In this study, we further demonstrated that the seroprevalence in dromedary calves increased gradually as their ages increased, with a sero-positivity of almost 100% in adult dromedaries. This is in line with the observation that MERS-CoV infections occur almost exclusively in dromedary calves after their maternal antibodies have disappeared. In fact, we have tested samples from the nose, trachea, tonsil, lung, uterus, and placenta of more than 100 adult female dromedaries dispatched to our veterinary laboratory for necropsy, and all have shown negative results (unpublished data). The high specificity of the N protein ELISA is confirmed in this field study. Recently, we reported the development of a monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA for MERS-CoV N protein and evaluated its specificity using nasopharyngeal specimens from patients with various common respiratory virus infections, including the four human CoVs, and its sensitivity using simulated nasopharyngeal specimens. 30 We argue that the ELISA may be used in animal field studies. In the present study, results of the N protein ELISA showed a concordance with those obtained from nucleic acid detection using dromedary nasal samples, indicating that the ELISA was highly specific. It is notable that there is one amino acid difference (L178V) between the N protein sequence of the MERS-CoV isolate of the present study and the original MERS-CoV isolate we used to generate the monoclonal antibodies for the N protein ELISA. This N protein ELISA would probably be useful in laboratories in the Middle East and North Africa, where resources and expertise may be limited. Further refinements of the test and the development of a rapid antigen detection kit for rapid diagnoses are warranted.

       "Globally, pneumonia is the commonest infectious cause of death and the second leading cause of overall life years lost (1) . In sub-Saharan Africa alone, lower respiratory tract infections account for 390,000 deaths in older children and adults each year (2) . Although the etiology and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has been thoroughly investigated in large cohorts of adults in well-resourced settings in Europe and North America (3, 4) and more recently in young children (,5 yr) from sub-Saharan Africa (5) , contemporary data on acute CAP in adults from sub-Saharan Africa are limited. With the exception of cohorts from South Africa (6, 7) , recent studies are small (8, 9) , retrospective (10) , or only use a restricted panel of investigations to define etiology (11) . In Malawi, a very-low-income country in Southern Africa, pneumonia is the commonest cause of adult hospitalization (12) . There is a generalized HIV epidemic (adult prevalence 10.6%) (13) and high tuberculosis (TB) incidence (159 cases per 100,000 population) (14) . These factors create a backdrop distinct from most wellresourced settings and common to many countries in the region that is likely to have a substantial bearing on the epidemiology and etiology of CAP; more comprehensive data are therefore crucial to develop appropriate context-specific management guidelines (15) . Given the continued rollout of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (16) , recent introduction of infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (17) , and the broader context of rapidly increasing life expectancy and emergence of chronic noncommunicable diseases (18) , contemporaneous data are vital. We therefore conducted a prospective study of adults hospitalized with CAP to the largest central hospital in Malawi to describe etiology and to identify risk factors for mortality to inform the development of local guidelines for antibiotic choice and severity assessment. Some of the results of this study have been previously reported in the form of abstracts (19, 20) . We conducted a prospective observational study of adults hospitalized with CAP at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, a 1,200bed teaching hospital that provides free healthcare to the 1.3 million residents of Blantyre district in Southern Malawi. Ethical approval was provided by the Research Ethics Committees of University of Malawi College of Medicine (P.11/12/1309) and Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (13.02). Some patients participated in linked case-control studies describing the impact of HIV on influenza severity (21) and the association of indoor air pollution exposure with pneumonia (22) . We recruited adults (>18 yr) hospitalized with clinically diagnosed CAP defined as: reported or recorded fever (>38 8 C), at least one relevant symptom (cough, chest pain, breathlessness, hemoptysis), and at least one focal chest sign (crepitations, pleural rub, bronchial breathing, percussive dullness, or diminished breath sounds) (adapted from Reference 23) . Patients with symptoms for more than 14 days, current antituberculous treatment, or prior admission within the last month were excluded. Further details of the eligibility criteria are provided in the online supplement. Written informed consent was provided by the patient, or in the case of incapacity, by their accompanying guardian. Patients underwent a standardized clinical assessment on admission and were reviewed daily during hospitalization and then followed at 30 and 90 days after admission to determine vital status. Blood, urine, sputum, and nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) were collected at enrolment. Diagnostic pleural aspiration was performed in patients with radiologically confirmed pleural effusion. Clinical care was provided in accordance with local guidelines and directed by the patients' clinical team. Chest radiographs were performed as early as possible after admission and independently reported by two radiologists and a study clinician using a standardized form. A consensus report of the three assessors was used for analysis. Radiographic pneumonia was defined as the presence of consolidation or other parenchymal abnormality (including reticulonodular change, cavitation, or miliary appearance) or pleural effusion (4) . Additional details are provided in the online supplement. Hematologic and biochemical analyses were performed by standard methods. HIV status was established by sequential rapid tests (Determine, Alere; and Uni-Gold, Trinity Biotech) (24) and CD4 cell count was performed on FACSCount flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Blood cultures were performed using aerobic bottles in the BacT/ALERT 3D automated system (bioMérieux) and isolates identified using standard procedures (25) Candidate risk factors for 30-day mortality were selected a priori based on literature review (26) (27) (28) (29) . Continuous variables, with the exception of age, were dichotomized at standard cutoff points (29) (30) (31) (32) . Univariable analyses were performed using logistic regression to explore associations with 30-day mortality. Multivariable models were generated using age, sex, HIV status, and all variables with a P value less than 0.2 on univariable analysis, prevalence of at least 5% and for which data were available in more than 95% of patients, and then rationalized by stepwise backward elimination with removal of variables with a P value greater than 0.05. The number of covariates in the multivariable model were limited to maintain at least 10 events per variable (33) . Subgroup analyses of HIV-infected patients and those with radiographic pneumonia were performed. The association of etiology with mortality was also assessed (see online supplement). All available case information was used in each univariable analysis. In multivariable models, we excluded patients with missing data for included variables. The prognostic performance of several CAP severity-assessment tools, such as CURB65 (29) , CRB65 (29), SMRT-CO (simplified version of the SMART-COP tool) (34) , modified Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society 2007 minor criteria (35) , and SWAT-Bp (28), for predicting 30-day mortality was described by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Details of how scores were calculated for each severityassessment tool are provided in the online supplement. Between May 15, 2013, and January 31, 2015, we screened 1,711 adult patients, of whom 489 fulfilled the eligibility criteria, 472 were enrolled, and 459 included in the analysis ( Figure 1 Table E5 ). At least one sputum specimen for a mycobacterial diagnostic test was obtained from 322/459 (70.2%) participants: smear microscopy, mycobacterial culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF assay were completed in 305/459 (66.4%), 273/459 (59.5%), and 308/459 (67.1%), respectively. A pleural fluid specimen was obtained in 35/459 (7.6%) patients: aerobic bacterial culture, S. pneumoniae antigen detection, and mycobacterial smear microscopy and culture were completed in 31, 31, and 35 patients, respectively. Overall at least one potential pathogen was identified in 278/459 (60.6%) patients including at least one bacterium in 125/452 (27.7%) and at least one virus in 148/459 (32.6%) ( Table 2 ). S. pneumoniae was the most commonly identified organism, present in 98 (21.4%) of 458 for whom results of blood culture and/or urinary antigen assay were available, of whom 92 (93.9%) were identified by detection of urinary antigen alone (see Table E5 ). Pneumococcal etiology was more common in HIV-uninfected patients ( Table E6 ), in particular confluent consolidation (OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.26-4.98) (see Table E7 ). Overall, 26 (5.8%) of 450 patients for whom blood was sent for culture were bacteremic: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (n = 9), nontyphoidal Salmonella (n = 7), and S. pneumoniae (n = 5) were most commonly isolated. S. Typhi was identified more frequently in HIV-uninfected patients (5/94 [5%] vs. 3/350 [1%]; P = 0.02), whereas all cases of nontyphoidal Salmonella infection occurred in HIVinfected patients, and both were more common among patients lacking radiographic pneumonia (see Table E6 ). Infection with M. pneumoniae (6/455; 1.3%) and C. pneumoniae (2/455; 0.4%) were uncommon. None of the 193 patients tested had a positive Legionella urinary antigen assay result. Overall, M. tuberculosis was identified in 75 (23.0%) of 326 patients who submitted a sputum and/or pleural fluid specimen (Table 2 ). TB was confirmed by culture in 65/75 (86.7%) and diagnosed on ORIGINAL ARTICLE the basis of Xpert MTB/RIF alone, sputum microscopy alone, or pleural fluid microscopy alone in 8/75 (10.7%), 1/75 (1.3%), and 1/75 (1.3%) patients, respectively (see Table E5 ). Nontuberculous mycobacteria were isolated in 8/273 (2.9%) for whom sputum for culture was obtained, of whom one was smear positive. The frequency of TB did not differ significantly between the groups with and without radiographic pneumonia ( Table E6 ), although in the latter, TB displaced S. pneumoniae as the most commonly identified pathogen, with all cases occurring in HIV-infected patients. Influenza (40/454; 8.8%), adenovirus (35/455; 7.7%), and coronavirus (31/455; 6.8%) were the most commonly detected viruses. Detection of these respiratory viruses was not associated with HIV status or the presence of radiographic pneumonia ( Table 2 ; see Table E6 ). Coinfection relationships were investigated in 307 patients (66.9% of cohort) for whom results for blood culture, pneumococcal urine antigen, sputum mycobacterial culture and/or Xpert MTB/RIF, and NPA PCR were available. At least one organism was detected in 206/307 (67.1%) and coinfection with two or more organisms was present in 67/307 (21.8%) ( Figure 2 ); the combination of bacterial-viral coinfection was most frequent (28/307; 9.1%). S. pneumoniae was codetected in one-fifth of patients with influenza (6/31; 19.4%). M. tuberculosis was isolated in 9.6% (7/73) of those with S. pneumoniae (see Table E8 ). Detection of multiple organisms did not vary with HIV status ( (Table 3) . Neither age nor any underlying comorbid illness, including HIV, or initial antimicrobial treatment was found to be significantly associated with 30day mortality. Detection of S. pneumoniae was associated with reduced mortality (aOR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.17-0.91) (see Table  E9 ), whereas TB was associated with increased mortality (aOR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.19-5.01). Mortality did not vary with detection of multiple organisms compared with a single organism (5/65 [7.7%] vs. 13/135 [9.6%]; P = 0.80). In a subgroup analysis of the 342 HIVinfected patients followed to Day 30, symptom duration greater than 7 days (aOR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.60-7.93), heart rate greater than or equal to 125 per minute (aOR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.40-6.71), oxygen saturations less than 90% (aOR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.28-6.88), inability to stand (aOR, 4.25; 95% CI, 1.84-9.79), and CD4 count less than 50 cells/mm 3 (aOR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.07-4.92) were associated with mortality in multivariable analysis (see Table E10 ). CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm 3  Lost to follow-up n=21 to 125 per minute (aOR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.08-6.57), and multilobar consolidation (aOR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.17-6.47) were significantly associated with mortality, with a trend toward an association for inability to stand (aOR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.00-6.89) (see Table E11 ). Thirty-day mortality was, however, significantly higher in the small group of patients for whom a chest radiograph was unavailable (17/36 [47.2%] vs. 47/403 [11.7%]; P , 0.0001) (see Table E3 ). (Table 4 ). CURB65 had poor sensitivity and discriminatory capability. Only 38 (8.8%) patients had \"severe CAP\" by CURB65 (i.e., score > 3) and mortality among those with \"mild CAP\" (i.e., CURB65 < 1) was 10.8% (29/268). The prognostic performance of each tool was similarly poor in the subgroup with radiographic pneumonia (see Table E12 ). In this prospective study of acute CAP in adults that is among the largest conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, we have shown that: the burden of hospitalized pneumonia in adults predominantly remains in young, HIV-infected patients; TB and vaccine-preventable pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae and influenza, are common; and mortality is substantial and associated with potentially modifiable risk factors but poorly predicted by widely used CAP severity-assessment tools. Although completed within the era of ART scale-up, 35% of HIV-infected patients were newly diagnosed, 17% of those with known HIV were not receiving ART, and more than three-quarters had advanced immunosuppression (i.e., CD4 , 200 cells/mm 3 ). Further substantial reductions in CAP incidence may therefore be achieved by improved HIV testing and linkage to early initiation of ART (36).  At first glance, the overall crude mortality rate of 14.6% is comparable with that seen in well-resourced settings (26, 29, 37) . However, a recent U.K. cohort reported 30-day mortality of 1.5% in patients younger than 50 (38), suggesting a substantially higher age-adjusted mortality rate in our cohort. The identified associations of TB and uncorrected hypoxemia with death, may explain some of this apparent large discrepancy in mortality rate. In keeping with other studies of acute CAP (7, 27, 28), we did not find evidence that HIV overall influenced outcome; increased mortality was evident in only the most profoundly immunocompromised with CD4 cell count less than 50 cells/ml. Given the observed strong association of hypoxemia with mortality, expansion of supplemental oxygen provision, which across much of sub-Saharan Africa is currently severely limited (39), represents an obvious strategy to be evaluated to improve CAP outcomes. Programmatic interventions in children in low-resource settings based on improved oxygen supply using oxygen concentrators have been associated with a 35% reduction in mortality (40) . The lack of association between respiratory rate and mortality underlines the importance of expanding the availability of pulse oximetry in tandem. Similarly, the association of prepresentation symptom duration with mortality suggests that interventions to improve patient education to alter health care-seeking behavior or referral mechanisms within community healthcare centers should be considered. The continued substantial mortality rate beyond Day 30 also warrants further study to devise targeted interventions to enhance care following discharge from hospital. The use of objective CAP severityassessment tools has been shown to improve the recognition of patients with severe CAP likely to require intensive care support (41) and those with mild disease who can be safely managed as outpatients (42) . Current South African CAP guidelines recommend that CURB65 is used to inform site of care and initial antimicrobial treatment (43) . However, we found that CURB65 showed poor prognostic performance in predicting 30-day mortality in this cohort compared with its performance in CAP cohorts from well-resourced settings (44) . This variation likely reflects differences in microbial etiology, demographics, and comorbidity profiles between this cohort and the patient populations in which CURB65 was derived (29) , and underlines the importance of prospective validation of prognostic tools in relevant settings (29, 44) . The similarly poor performance of the SWAT-Bp score that was derived in a lower respiratory tract infection cohort from Malawi (28), however, highlights the challenges of developing a simple and accurate locally adapted tool. Rather than attempting to derive a single tool capable of accurately predicting mortality across the whole spectrum of disease severity, a tool with high negative predictive performance aimed at identifying those patients with a low risk of adverse outcome suitable for outpatient management may be more feasible and equally useful. In this respect, the SMRT-CO tool performed well with a negative predictive value of 96.8%, but the inclusion *Excluded from multivariable analysis because of prevalence <5%. † Excluded a priori from multivariable analysis because of assumed collinearity with systolic blood pressure. ‡ Excluded a priori because of assumed collinearity with MUAC. x Excluded a priori because of assumed collinearity with urea. k Excluded from multivariable analysis because data were missing for .5% of patients. For each tool, the performance characteristics displayed are those using the scoring threshold for \"severe CAP\" as suggested by the authors. *Score calculated in varying number of patients depending on availability of results for component parameters; SMRT-CO and modified IDSA/ATS minor criteria include a radiologic parameter and thus were only calculated in those with radiographic pneumonia. of a radiographic parameter (i.e., multilobar involvement) (34) limits its use as a triage tool in settings where chest radiography might not be readily available. Recent CAP studies corroborate our observation that S. pneumoniae remains the commonest identified cause of adult CAP in sub-Saharan Africa (6, 10, 27) . Universal infant vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was introduced in Malawi in 2011, approximately 2.5 years before the start of recruitment. Following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in the United States and South Africa, rates of adult pneumococcal disease (including pneumonia hospitalizations) fell rapidly as a result of indirect protection caused by reduced pneumococcal transmission from vaccine recipients (45, 46) . Further studies are needed to describe the serotype distribution of pneumococcal pneumonia in Malawi, to determine whether targeted vaccination programs of at-risk groups may be beneficial to tackle the persistent burden of adult disease. Recently developed urinary assays that can detect serotype-specific antigens in noninvasive pneumococcal pneumonia may provide a more comprehensive description (47) . When adequate diagnostic tests are performed, TB is identified in a substantial proportion of patients presenting with acute CAP in sub-Saharan Africa with the major burden of disease and associated mortality occurring in HIV-infected individuals (7-9; 27) . At 23% of those tested and 16% of the overall cohort, the frequency of TB is similar to that previously reported (7-9; 27), but probably underestimates the true burden given the reliance on spontaneously expectorated sputum specimens and a single specimen submitted for culture. In most sub-Saharan African settings, laboratory diagnosis of TB has until recently relied on sputum smear microscopy that has poor sensitivity, particularly for HIV-associated TB. The World Health Organization has advocated an empirical \"step-up\" approach, whereby antituberculous treatment is initiated for HIV-infected adults with features of severe respiratory infection and negative sputum smears who fail to improve after 3-5 days of antibacterial treatment (48) . Although this approach may limit inappropriate antituberculous treatment, it may miss up to 20% of patients with culture-positive TB and risks delaying treatment in a group of patients with a very high risk of early death (49) . The increasingly available Xpert MTB/RIF assay used in this study offers much improved sensitivity and is now recommended as the first-line diagnostic for HIV-associated TB (50) . Rapid urine-based diagnostics (e.g., urine Xpert MTB/RIF, mycobacterial glycopeptide lipoarabinomannan assay) may have a complementary role to guide initiation of antituberculous treatment, particularly for acutely ill patients from whom sputum is frequently unobtainable (51, 52) . In keeping with recent CAP studies from well-resourced settings that have used molecular diagnostics (4, 53), we identified high rates of coinfection with multiple organisms, most commonly bacterialviral coisolation. Defining the clinical significance of each organism detected is challenging, particularly among immunocompromised individuals. Although coisolation may reflect genuine copathogenicity or simply detection of bystander colonizing organisms, more complex relationships in which one organism facilitates the acquisition or pathogenesis of another (e.g., influenza and S. pneumoniae) (54) are possible. Bacterial-viral coinfection has been associated with altered levels of innate immune factors (e.g., CRP and IP10) (55) and a more severe clinical course (56) . Further work is needed to define the implications for CAP therapy and prevention. Radiographic facilities are limited in most healthcare facilities in sub-Saharan Africa where the majority of CAP patients are initially managed. Although the clinical case definition used in this study may have missed some patients with radiographic pneumonia who lacked focal signs at the time of recruitment it nonetheless reflects routine clinical practice and usefully provides data to show how the etiologic spectrum of disease varies with chest radiograph findings (57) . The association of radiographic changes compatible with infection with S. pneumoniae is unsurprising. Although still relatively uncommon, the greater prevalence of invasive Salmonella infection among those lacking radiographic pneumonia has important implications for antimicrobial management. Although specific radiologic features were statistically associated with certain pathogens, the marked interobserver variability in interpretation of these features suggests that the clinical utility of this approach is limited. In recruiting patients exclusively from a single referral hospital, this study shares the limitations common to many CAP observational cohorts. Most patients were seen at another facility before attendance; how they were selected for referral and, correspondingly, the characteristics and outcome of those treated at home is unknown. Hence, the applicability of the findings to community-level settings is potentially limited. Extrapolation of these findings to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa must also be done cautiously because of the potential impact that variations in such factors as TB incidence, HIV prevalence, and climate may have on CAP epidemiology and etiology. Given limitations of the healthcare infrastructure in Malawi, chronic comorbid illnesses may be underdiagnosed. Inconsistencies in drug supply, equipment provision, and staff experience may result in variations in CAP treatment that may impact patient outcome but are not fully accounted for in analyses. The description of CAP etiology was limited by the lack of sputum microscopy and culture, which may have increased the detection of bacterial pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae as has been described in previous studies from the region (27, 58) . Similarly, we were unable to support invasive respiratory sampling for diagnostic testing for Pneumocystis jirovecii and other HIV-associated opportunistic pathogens. The low rate of bacteremia observed may relate to both prehospital antibiotic use and antibiotic initiation before blood couture collection in hospital, which occurred in up to onethird of patients. Interpretation of the significance of respiratory pathogen multiplex PCR results, particularly for respiratory viruses, is hampered by the lack of data from an appropriate control population. The relative contribution of pathogens with seasonal transmission patterns (e.g., influenza) may also have been skewed by a recruitment period that spanned 2 incomplete years. In conclusion, more than a decade after the introduction of ART, the major burden of CAP in Malawi remains in young patients with HIV rather than the elderly patients with chronic noncommunicable comorbidities that predominate in well-resourced settings. Accordingly, context-specific approaches to severity assessment and defining empirical antimicrobial treatment are needed. The predominance of S. pneumoniae and influenza suggests significant opportunities for CAP prevention through targeted vaccination programs. Strategies to encourage prompt patient presentation, to increase early detection and treatment of TB, and to improve supportive care, in particular the correction of hypoxemia, should be evaluated in clinical trials to address the high burden of CAP-related mortality. n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.

       "Baculoviruses are a diverse group of DNA viruses capable of infecting more than 600 insects, among which Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is the best characterized and most extensively employed, thus baculovirus discussed in this article refers to AcMNPV unless otherwise noted. AcMNPV contains a circular dsDNA genome of ≈134 kb and replicates in a bi-phasic fashion. The viral proteins polyhedrin and p10 are expressed abundantly in infected cells and are dispensable for virus replication, thus recombinant baculovirus can be constructed by placing the foreign gene under the control of polyhedrin or p10 promoter, and used to infect insect cells for foreign gene expression. Such baculovirus-insect cell expression system has been exhaustively utilized for the production of numerous recombinant proteins (Kost and Condreay, 1999) and commercial vaccine products such as Cervarix ® and Provenge ® (Hitchman et al., 2009; . In addition to insect cells, baculovirus is able to transduce animal cells of human, rodent, rabbit, porcine, bovine, fish and avian origins (Hu, 2005 (Hu, , 2006 as well as relatively primitive cells including embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells (Table 1 ) and induced pluripotent stem cells (Fig. 1) . Within the baculovirus-transduced cells, the transgene can be expressed as long as it is driven by an appropriate promoter (e.g. cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV) or hybrid CAG promoter consisting of the CMV early enhancer and chicken β-actin promoter). Baculovirus cloning capacity is as large as 38 kb (Cheshenko et al., 2001) , thus allowing for the insertion of multiple genes and regulatory elements (Kost et al., 2005; Kost and Condreay, 2002) . Baculovirus neither replicates inside the transduced cells nor integrates its DNA into host chromosomes in the absence of selective pressure (Chen et al., 2011a; Merrihew et al., 2001) , hence easing the safety concerns. Humans do not possess pre-existing antibody and T-cells specifically against baculovirus (Strauss et al., 2007) , therefore baculovirus may circumvent the pre-existing immunity problem faced by other viral vectors. Finally, recombinant baculovirus can be readily constructed and propagated to high titers in biosafety level 1 facilities by infecting its natural host insect cells (Hu, 2008) . These attributes have fueled growing interests to explore baculovirus for a wide variety of applications, ranging from protein production (Jardin et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010) , virus production Lesch et al., 2008 Lesch et al., , 2011 Lucifora et al., 2008; McCormick et al., 2002; Nakowitsch et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2010) , virus-like particle production (Chen et al., 2005; Matsuo et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2005) , eucaryotic protein display (Ernst et al., 2006, Grabherr and Ernst, 2010) , vaccine development Madhan et al., 2010; Tani et al., 2008) , cancer therapy (Wang and Balasundaram, 2010) , cell-based assay development (Condreay et al., 2006; Condreay and Kost, 2007; Kost et al., 2010) to tissue engineering (Lin et al., 2010b) . This article will focus on recent understandings of intracellular events after baculovirus transduction and latest applications of baculovirus for antiviral therapy, cancer therapy, tissue regeneration and vaccine development. Baculovirus entry into mammalian cells was initially suggested to depend on electrostatic interactions (Duisit et al., 1999) , heparin sulfate (Duisit et al., 1999) and phospholipids (Tani et al., 2001) , but the exact cell surface molecules for baculovirus docking remained unknown. It was also proposed that clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Long et al., 2006; Matilainen et al., 2005) and macropinocytosis (Matilainen et al., 2005) play roles in baculovirus entry. Contradictorily, a recent study (Laakkonen et al., 2009 ) discovered that (1) baculovirus entered HEK293 and HepG2 cells along fluid-phase markers from the raft areas into vesicles devoid of clathrin; (2) macropinocytosis-related regulators (e.g. EIPA, Pak1, Rab34 and Rac1) imparted no significant effects on virus transduction and (3) the internalization and nuclear uptake were affected by the regulators of clathrin-independent entry. These data unveiled a baculovirus entry pathway independent of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and suggested Table 1 Selected types of cells permissive to baculovirus transduction.

Moreover, other recent studies reported that baculovirus transduction related to direct fusion pathway induced by a short pH trigger (Dong et al., 2010; Paul and Prakash, 2010) . These conflicting data underlined the need for more in-depth studies to elucidate the underlying mechanism and might suggest that baculovirus entry pathway varies with cell types. Nevertheless, one consensus is that baculovirus envelope protein gp64 is pivotal for entry because blocking gp64 can abrogate the baculovirus ability to transduce mammalian cells (Abe et al., 2005; Niu et al., 2008) and activate dendritic cells (DCs) (Schutz et al., 2006) . Once inside the cells, baculovirus is transported to the endosome, followed by endosomal escape via acid-triggered gp64 fusion (Kukkonen et al., 2003) and subsequent nuclear transport van Loo et al., 2001) with the aid of actin filament (Matilainen et al., 2005; Salminen et al., 2005) . A major component of type III intermediate filaments, vimentin, also participates in intracellular trafficking (Mahonen et al., 2010) . Vimentin is reorganized in the optimized culture medium and is linked to enhanced nuclear entry of baculovirus, underscoring the importance of culture medium in the cytoskeleton network assembly and in baculoviral gene delivery. Baculovirus encodes ≈155 genes and a number of viral genes (e.g. orf149, ie0, p35 and gp64) are expressed in transduced mammalian cells (Fujita et al., 2006; Kitajima et al., 2006) . Among the baculoviral genes, ie1 is expressed early in insect cells and transactivates downstream gene expression. Forced expression of ie1 by the minimal CMV promoter in Vero E6 cells also markedly activates gp64 and pe38, and upregulates ie2, he65, pcna, orf16, orf17 and orf25 (Liu et al., 2007) . The critical role of ie1 for transactivating downstream genes was further unraveled in a recent study , which showed that baculovirus deficient in ie1 gene mitigates residual baculoviral gene expression 10-to 100-fold (when compared with wild-type baculovirus) in transduced mammalian cells, thus enhancing safety features to baculovirus-based gene therapy. In contrast to ie1, ie2 overexpression driven by the CMV promoter only upregulates 2 baculoviral genes (pe38 and orf17), but baculovirusmediated co-expression of ie1 and ie2 acts in concert to upregulate 59 out of 155 baculovirus genes in mammalian cells (Liu et al., 2007) . Strikingly, IE2 is a strong transactivator of CMV promoter in both Vero E6 and U-2OS cells (Liu et al., 2009a) . When overexpressed within the baculovirus context, IE2 forms the nuclear foci and develops into large nuclear bodies (NBs) with a hollow center. The IE2 NBs structure contains abundant G-actin, closely associates with RNA polymerase II, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO1) and is the site of active transcription, thereby contributing to the IE2-associated gene stimulation (Liu et al., 2009a) . Furthermore, the NBs formation and CMV promoter activation require the N-terminal RING finger and C-terminal coiled-coil domains of IE2 (Liu et al., 2009a) . Since CMV promoter is exhaustively used for baculovirus-mediated gene transfer, the transactivating activity of IE2 may be useful for baculovirus-mediated protein production in mammalian cells . Due to the complex cascade of events during baculovirus transduction, it is not surprising that baculovirus can alter the cell morphology and trigger cellular responses. For instance, baculovirus transduction of HepG2 cells alters the size of PML NBs, induces remodeling of the host cell chromatin and arouses extensive ruffle formation on the cell surface (Laakkonen et al., 2009) . Shotgun proteomics also attests that baculovirus-transduced HepG2 cells exhibit a slight induction of proteins related to inflammation, cell survival and chromatin function (Gerner et al., 2010) . The most well-characterized baculovirus-induced cellular response is the innate immune response, as manifested by the induction of such cytokines as interferon α/β (IFN-α/β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (Abe and Matsuura, 2010; Tani et al., 2008) . Baculovirus transduction of rat chondrocytes also elicits transient expression of IFN-α/β, which attenuates the transgene expression (Lee et al., 2009) . Not only the cytokine secretion, in vitro baculovirus transduction also activates human (Schutz et al., 2006) and mouse (Abe et al., 2005) DCs. Moreover, wild-type baculovirus transduction of mouse bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) upregulates the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and II and co-stimulation molecules (e.g. CD40, CD80 and CD86) (Suzuki et al., 2010a) . The activated BMDCs can further stimulate natural killer (NK) cells upon coculture, as evidenced by the IFN-γ production, CD69 upregulation and cell proliferation. In contrast to these differentiated, specialized cells, stem cells appear to be less sensitive to baculovirus transduction. Upon wildtype baculovirus transduction, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) secret IL-6 and IL-8, but no detectable levels of IFN-γ, IFN-β, TNF-α, TNF-β, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-12 (Chen et al., 2009b) . Human leukocyte antigen I (HLA-I) is slightly upregulated, but the expression of HLA-II and other surface markers are barely disturbed (Bak et al., 2010; Chuang et al., 2009) . Neither does baculovirus transduction compromise the immunosuppressive properties of BMSCs . Conversely, wildtype baculovirus transduction of mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) elicits only the chemokine IP-10, but not other wellknown cytokines (unpublished data). BMSCs and iPSCs are promising cell sources for regenerative medicine. The lack of these cytokine responses reduces the risk of mounting strong immune responses after transplantation of baculovirus-transduced BMSCs and iPSCs. In vivo, baculovirus administration triggers innate immune responses, activates macrophages (Abe et al., 2005) , DCs (Hervas-Stubbs et al., 2007; Schutz et al., 2006) and NK cells (Facciabene et al., 2004; Kitajima et al., 2008) . The baculovirus-induced innate immunity gives rise to antitumor activity (Suzuki et al., 2010a) and is sufficient to confer protection against influenza virus in mice (Abe et al., 2003) , infectious bronchitis virus in chickens (Niu et al., 2008) and foot-and-mouth-disease virus in mice (Molinari et al., 2010) . The innate immunity also confers baculovirus the adjuvant activity to promote humoral and cellular immune responses against co-administered antigens (Hervas-Stubbs et al., 2007) . Moreover, intramuscular (i.m.) injection of baculovirus triggers T-cell responses against the vector, but the magnitude of anti-baculovirus T cells response is lower than that of anti-adenovirus response (Hervas-Stubbs et al., 2007) . Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors essential for initiating the innate immunity and substantiating the adaptive immunity (Ishii et al., 2008) . For instance, TLR3 recognizes virus-derived dsRNA while TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA motifs. Upon engagement with cognate ligands, TLRs are activated and recruit adaptor molecules such as myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88) and TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF) to transduce signals to downstream molecules. Besides, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a cytoplasmic sensor that activates IRF3 and IFN-α/β in response to viral dsDNA while retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) are TLR-independent cytoplasmic RNA detectors that induce the IFN-α/β production through IFN promoter-stimulator-1 (IPS-1). Baculovirus-induced innate immunity has been ascribed to the recognition of CpG motifs in viral DNA and ensuing activation of TLR9/ MyD88-dependent pathway (Abe et al., 2005) . The detection activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and leads to subsequent IFN-α/β production. However, IFN-α/β are still produced in peritoneal cells derived from MyD88-or TLR9-deficient mice (Abe et al., 2005) . In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), baculovirus triggers IFN-β and IFN-inducible chemokines through TLR-independent and IRF3-dependent pathways and endosomal maturation is required for induction (Abe et al., 2009) . These data suggest that baculovirus DNA might be recognized by at least two different pathways: TLR9-dependent endosomal recognition and TLR9independent cytoplasmic recognition. The latter was suggested to be related to STING (Abe and Matsuura, 2010) because baculovirus-induced IFN-α/β production was impaired in STING-deficient MEFs (Ishikawa et al., 2009 ), yet IFN-α/β stimulation was found to be independent of other cytoplasmic RNA detectors such as RIG-I and MDA5 (Abe et al., 2009 ). However, a recent study noted that RIG-I and MDA5 mRNA levels were elevated in baculovirus-transduced cells . Addition of DNA methytransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) prior to transduction retarded such upregulation and enhanced baculovirus-mediated gene expression, suggesting that DNMTi may somehow facilitate the baculovirus evasion from the cellular recognition and thus ameliorate the transgene expression. Using the cDNA microarray, Wang and coworkers discovered that baculovirus injection into the striatum in the rat brain perturbed the expression of 628 genes, which represented 3.45% of the total gene probes on the microarray . The same study also identified 532 gene probes (1.99%) in human astrocytes and 1219 gene probes (4.32%) in human neuronal cells that were disturbed in response to baculovirus. Despite the disparity between cell types, in all 3 samples baculovirus altered the expression of genes associated with TLR signaling pathway (e.g. TLR2, TLR3, CCL5, CXCL10 and STAT1) and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (e.g. CXCL10, CXCL11 and CCL5). Moreover, genes associated with interferon induction-related genes (e.g. CXCL10, MX1, MX2, OAS1 and STAT1) and antigen processing and presentation pathway (e.g. CD74 and RT-1Ba) were affected. As such, Wang and coworkers proposed that baculovirus recognition by TLRs triggers the expression of IFN-α/β, which initiates the subsequent signaling cascade involving STATs, upregulating the expression of IFN-responsive genes and hence confers the cells the antiviral state. Concurrent with the aforementioned findings, we also discovered that baculovirus transduction of human BMSCs disturbed the expression of 816 genes, most of which were related to 5 signaling pathways: cell adhesion molecules, TLR, Jak-STAT, apoptosis as well as antigen processing and presentation (Chen et al., 2009b) . Of note, baculovirus triggered the TLR3 pathway, resulting in downstream NF-κB and IRF-3 activation and IL-6/IL-8 production. However, how baculovirus containing the dsDNA genome activated the dsRNA sensor TLR3 remains an enigma. Also, the transduction did not arouse the secretion of IFN-β (Chen et al., 2009b) , a signature cytokine associated with TLR3 activation, implying a signaling cascade somewhat distinct from that in immune cells. Interestingly, the budded form of another baculovirus, Antheraea pernyi nuclear polyhedrosis virus (ApNPV), triggers the TLR21 signaling in chicken macrophage-like cells (HD11) but not in chicken B cell-like cells (Han et al., 2010) . ApNPV transduction of HD11 cells concomitantly induces the production of IFN-γ, IL-12p40 and nitric oxide (NO) (Niu et al., 2008) , which is accompanied by the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as well as activation of p65-NF-κB (Han et al., 2009 ). Inhibition of p38 MAPK and NF-κB by their respective inhibitors abrogates the expression of cytokines and NO, whereas inhibition of JNK abolishes only the induction of cytokines. Since in mammals TLRs signaling activates the downstream NF-κB and MAPK cascade comprised of at least p38 MAPK, ERK 1/2, and JNK (Ishii et al., 2008) , these data altogether suggest that ApNPV transduction of HD11 cells activates TLR21 and signals though NF-κB, p38 MAPK and JNK pathways, and chicken TLR21 might play a role similar to mammalian TLR9 (Han et al., 2009 (Han et al., , 2010 . Baculovirus envelope protein gp64 comprises an N-terminal signal peptide and a mature domain that encompasses the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain (CTD). Heterologous protein/peptide has been inserted in between the signal peptide and mature domain, which after expression under the polyhedrin or p10 promoter as a fusion protein is translocated to the plasma membrane and incorporated into the viral envelope upon virus budding. Such feature has been exploited for surface display of protein/peptide to improve the virus transduction (Grabherr and Ernst, 2010; Grabherr et al., 2001; Raty et al., 2004) or for ligand-directed targeting if an appropriate ligand is chosen (Kitagawa et al., 2005; Makela et al., , 2008 . For instance, baculovirus poorly transduces B lymphocytes (Cheng et al., 2004; Condreay et al., 1999) . Via gp64 fusion, the transduction has been enhanced by displaying the short peptide motif from gp350/220 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, which naturally infects B cells) on the baculovirus envelope (Ge et al., 2007) . Alternatively, the cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) has been fused to gp64 to enhance the baculovirus transduction of Vero E6, U-2OS and CHO-RD cells (Chen et al., 2011b) . Another paradigm is the display of the fragment crystallisable (Fc) region of antibody on the baculovirus surface (Martyn et al., 2009) . Fc receptors (FcRs) are membrane proteins that bind to the Fc region of antibody and mediate the phagocytosis and antigen presentation. The Fc display allows for specific baculovirus targeting to cell lines and antigen presenting cells (APCs) expressing FcRs, hence augmenting the vaccine effect (Martyn et al., 2009 ). The display system also allows for the surface presentation of functional membrane proteins to simplify subsequent isolation . Aside from the gp64-aided display, expression of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) (Chapple and Jones, 2002; Makela and Oker-Blom, 2006) , influenza virus neuraminidase (Borg et al., 2004) , Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus F protein (Yu et al., 2009) , single chain antibody fragments (Kitidee et al., 2010) and human endogenous retrovirus envelope protein (Lee et al., 2010) in insect cells also leads to incorporation of the protein into baculovirus envelope. Among these strategies, display of VSVG or heterologous peptide/protein via the VSVG anchor is the most widely adopted and can tremendously enhance baculovirus transduction in vitro and in vivo (Facciabene et al., 2004; Kaikkonen et al., 2006; Kaneko et al., 2006; Kitagawa et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2006; Tani et al., 2003 Tani et al., , 2001 Zhou and Blissard, 2008) . Serum complement proteins (e.g. C5b-9) inactivate baculovirus, hence constituting a major hurdle in the in vivo use of baculovirus. The inactivation problem has been circumvented by the use of complement inhibitors such as compstatin (Georgopoulos et al., 2009 ) and soluble complement inhibitor 1 (Hoare et al., 2005; Hofmann et al., 1999) , avoiding exposure to the complement (Airenne et al., 2000) or administrating the vector to immunoprivileged sites (Kinnunen et al., 2009; Lehtolainen et al., 2002) . Alternatively, the baculoviral vector can become complement-resistant by displaying human DAF (decay accelerating factor) via gp64 fusion (Huser et al., 2001 , Kaname et al., 2010 . More recently, baculoviral vectors displaying different complement regulatory proteins (e.g. DAF, factor H-like protein-1, C4bbinding protein and membrane cofactor protein) were generated by fusion with the membrane anchor of VSVG (Kaikkonen et al., 2010) . These surface-modified vectors exhibited varying degrees of complement resistance in vitro and DAF yielded the highest level of protection. Intraportal delivery of the DAF-displaying baculovirus increased the survival and gene expression in immunocompetent mice. The DAF-displaying baculovirus provoked lower levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12p40 in macrophages and mitigated liver inflammation in mice when compared with the control virus. These results prove that DAF display offers protection to the baculoviral vector against complement inactivation and attenuates complement-mediated inflammation injury. Other than the display on the envelope, heterologous protein has been displayed on the capsid by fusion with the major capsid protein VP39. The VP39 fusion with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) neither interferes with the virus assembly nor affects the virus tier, thereby enabling intracellular baculovirus trafficking and biodistribution monitoring (Kukkonen et al., 2003) . Similarly, the ZnO binding peptide has been fused to the N-terminus of VP39 while retaining the viral infectivity and conferring the ability to bind nanosized ZnO powders (Song et al., 2010) . Besides, by fusing the protein transduction domain (PTD) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) TAT protein (a protein responsible for nuclear import of HIV genome) with VP39, the engineered baculovirus results in improved transduction of various mammalian cells (Chen et al., 2011b) . In addition to surface modification by genetic engineering, baculovirus has been labeled with tracers for tracking (Li et al., 2004) or biodistribution imaging Raty et al., 2007) . Chemical coupling of antigenic peptides also enables rapid modification of baculovirus particles and delivery of multiple epitopes (Wilson et al., 2008) . Baculovirus can also be chemically conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) alone (Kim et al., 2006) or together with folate (Kim et al., 2007 (Kim et al., , 2010 to improve the transduction of folate receptor-positive KB cells. Additionally, baculoviral vectors have been coated with positively charged polyethylenimine (25 kDa) through electrostatic interactions (Yang et al., 2009) . The modification imparts baculoviral vectors resistance to human and rat serum-mediated inactivation in vitro and elevates in vivo transduction in the liver and spleen after tail vein injection into mice. RNA interference (RNAi) is a phenomenon that mediates sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing and can be artificially elicited by the expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) precursors from an expression vector (Garzon et al., 2010) . Since the initial demonstrations of baculovirus-mediated shRNA delivery (Nicholson et al., 2005; Ong et al., 2005) , baculovirusmediated RNAi has been explored for antiviral therapy. One baculovirus expressing the shRNA specific for the C-terminal nucleoprotein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) genome inhibits the viral replication in vitro (Lu et al., 2006) . The baculovirus harboring a bispecific shRNA targeted against influenza virus A and B can inhibit the production of both virus types in transduced cell lines (Suzuki et al., 2009b) . Another baculovirus expressing shRNA against the peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) represses PPRV replication in vitro and the inhibition effect is superior to that mediated by the adenovirus expressing the same shRNA (Nizamani et al., 2011) . Hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA is the source of HBV transcripts in chronically infected patients. Baculovirus expressing the HBV-specific shRNA is able to hinder the formation of HBV CCC DNA (Starkey et al., 2009) . Additionally, the baculovirus expressing shRNAs specific for the highly conserved core region of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome dramatically impedes the target protein expression (Suzuki et al., 2009c) . The replication and segregation of EBV genomes to daughter cells is coordinated by the binding of EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) to oriP, an origin of replication derived from EBV. To prolong the transgene expression, baculoviral vectors incorporating the oriP/ EBNA1 sequences were developed (Shan et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2008) . Based on this concept, Suzuki et al. devised a baculoviral vector that accommodated the oriP/EBNA1 sequence and encoded the HCVspecific shRNA. This vector inhibited HCV core protein expression for N14 days, which considerably outlasted the 3 days of inhibition conferred by the conventional vector (Suzuki et al., 2009a) . Recently, we also exploited the baculovirus vector for miRNA delivery and gene regulation. The baculovirus vectors carried artificial gene-specific miRNA sequences within the miR155 scaffold, which after expression under the CMV promoter could undergo the miRNA processing pathway and knocked down the target gene (e.g. EGFP and TNF-α) expression (unpublished data). The gene suppression effect was extended by flanking the miRNA expression cassette with the inverted terminal repeat sequences/direct repeats sequences (IR/DR) recognized by the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase. Co-transduction of cells with the hybrid baculovirus/transposon vector and another SB transposase-expressing baculovirus resulted in the integration of miRNA expression cassette into the chromosome, giving rise to prolonged target gene suppression (unpublished data). These data altogether implicate the potential of baculovirus-based RNAi shuttle for antiviral therapy and treatment of indications necessitating prolonged gene regulation (e.g. arthritis). The feasibility of baculovirus-mediated cancer therapy was first explored by Wang et al. (2006) , who developed a baculoviral vector expressing the Diphtheria Toxin A and demonstrated that the baculovirus impeded the growth of cultured glioma cells and glioma xenograft in the rat brain. Since then, baculovirus has been utilized for the treatment of mouse hepatoma (Kitajima et al., 2008) , murine melanoma, lung cancer and brain cancer (Kim et al., 2007) . Recently, Wang and coworkers constructed another baculovirus that selectively expressed herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) in tumors for glioma suicide gene therapy (Balani et al., 2009 ). The HSVtk gene was driven by a truncated human high mobility group box2 (HMGB2) promoter, which allowed HSVtk expression in glioblastoma tissues but not in normal brain tissues. This vector triggered death of glioblastoma cells in the presence of ganciclovir, but did not affect the survival of human astrocytes and neurons. In a mouse xenograft model, intratumoral injection of this baculovirus at 7 days after tumor inoculation suppressed the growth of human glioblastoma and prolonged the mouse survival. However, the tumor mass was not completely eradicated after one single baculovirus injection, presumably due to the transient HSVtk expression (Balani et al., 2009) . Alternatively, the HSVtk gene was driven by the GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) promoter whose activity is similar in normal and tumor cells of the same lineage (Wu et al., 2009a) . To limit the transgene expression in glioma cells, repeated target sequences of 3 miRNAs (has-miR31, has-miR127 and has-miR143) that are enriched in astrocytes but are sparse in glioblastoma cells were appended to the 3′ untranslated region of the HSVtk gene. The baculovirus vector markedly improved in vivo selectivity when compared with the control vector without miRNA regulation, effectively inhibited human glioma xenograft and imparted negligible toxicity to normal astrocytes. The incorporation of selected miRNA sponge thus provides an additional safety switch to prevent off-target transgene expression (Wu et al., 2009a) . In addition to HSVtk, the baculovirus expressing NES1 (normal epithelial cell specific-1) can inhibit the growth of gastric cancer cells (SGC-7901) in vitro and repress the SGC-7901 xenografted tumor growth after intratumoral injection, implicating the possibility for the therapy of gastric and colon cancers (Huang et al., 2008) . Baculovirus can also carry tumor suppressor genes such as p53 or pdcd4 (programmed cell death 4) for cancer treatment. In the mouse glioma xenograft models, the antitumor effect of the baculovirus-expressed p53 was substantiated by surface coating of the baculovirus envelope with polyethylenimine (Yang et al., 2009) or by co-administering sodium butyrate (Guo et al., 2011) , a histone deacetylase inhibitor that ameliorates baculovirus-mediated gene expression (Guo et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2003; Yin et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2010) . The PDCD4expressing baculovirus conjugated with folate-PEG efficiently expressed PDCD4 protein and induced apoptosis in human epidermal carcinoma cells (Kim et al., 2010) . In a tumor xenograft, intratumoral injection of the PDCD4-expressing baculovirus significantly suppressed tumor growth and induced apoptosis. Moreover, apoptin is a chicken anemia virus-derived protein that specifically triggers apoptosis in tumors. The VSVG-pseudotyped baculovirus expressing apoptin efficiently provoked apoptosis in mammalian cells, repressed the growth of xenograft tumors and prolonged the mice survival after intratumoral injection (Pan et al., 2010) . One determinant to the baculovirus-mediated antitumor effects is the innate immune responses elicited by the virus (Suzuki et al., 2010b) . Takaku and coworkers demonstrated that wild-type baculo-virus, after intravenous (i.v.) injection into immunocompetent B6 mouse, was taken up by the liver and spleen, preferentially entered DCs and B cells, activated DCs, induced NK cells proliferation in the liver and spleen, and enhanced the antitumor immunity in mice with B16 liver metastases (Kitajima et al., 2008) . Baculovirus administration also increased the survival of C57BL/6, Jα281 −/− and IFN-γ −/− mice bearing the B16 tumor, but did not enhance the survival of NK cell-depleted mice. These results prove that wild-type baculovirus efficiently induces NK cell-mediated antitumor immunity (Kitajima et al., 2008) . Besides direct injection, baculovirus has been employed in conjunction with cell therapy for cancer treatment. Bone marrowderived DCs (BMDCs), after ex vivo transduction with wild-type baculovirus and i.v. injection into mice, significantly suppressed the lung cancer (Suzuki et al., 2010a) . In a mouse melanoma model, baculovirus-transduced BMDCs inhibited tumor growth and improved animal survival at least partly due to the induction of CD8+ T cell-and NK cell-dependent, CD4+ T cell-independent antitumor immunity. Importantly, BMDCs administration did not provoke evident signs of damage to the liver or kidney, as judged from the negligible disturbance of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatine levels (Suzuki et al., 2010a) . Another promising cell courier is BMSCs thanks to their intrinsic tumor homing property. In this regard, BMSCs were transduced with a baculovirus expressing HSVtk and injected via tail vein into the mice pre-inoculated with human U87 glioma cells (Bak et al., 2010) . After ganciclovir injection, tumor growth was significantly repressed and the life span of animals was considerably prolonged. More recently, the same group generated MSC-like cells from human embryonic stem (ES) cells which, after transduction with the baculovirus expressing HSVtk and injection into the brain, were capable of inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging the survival of tumor-bearing mice in the presence of ganciclovir (Bak et al., 2011) . These data implicated the feasibility of human ES cells-derived MSCs as a viable and attractive alternative for cancer therapy. Gene therapy has converged with tissue engineering, by which the therapeutic genes stimulating tissue regeneration can be administered to cells either in vivo or ex vivo with an appropriate vector. Given the highly efficient gene delivery, baculovirus has been used for cartilage and bone engineering (Lin et al., 2010b) . Articular cartilage is a weight-bearing tissue comprising chondrocytes and extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of proteins (e.g. collagen II) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as aggrecan. Articular cartilage may be damaged due to direct trauma or joint diseases, but its ability to self-repair is limited, ultimately leading to debilitating pain and physical impairment. Therefore, cartilage tissue engineering that combines cells, scaffolds and biological signals has emerged for cartilage repair. Given that chondrocytes are pivotal in the synthesis, composition modulation, structural arrangement of ECM components and hence the mechanical properties, we developed a protocol for baculovirus transduction of rat (Ho et al., 2004) and rabbit chondrocytes. This protocol involves the incubation of cells with the virus at 25-27°C for 4-8 h using Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) as the surrounding solution and confers efficiencies higher than 90% . The key to such high transduction efficiencies is the absence of NaHCO 3 in D-PBS, which hinders the baculovirus transduction (Shen et al., 2007) . Consequently, the surrounding solution has been replaced with NaHCO 3 -deficient DMEM medium . Critically, chondrocytes transduced with an EGFP-expressing baculovirus remain capable of producing cartilage-specific collagen II and GAGs, and grow into cartilaginous tissues when seeded into the porous, poly (L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffold and cultivated dynamically . These data demonstrate that baculovirus transduction of chondrocytes does not obstruct the chondrocytes differentiation. Therefore, we further constructed 3 baculovirus vectors each expressing one growth factor (TGF-β1, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) or bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)) known to stimulate chondrogenesis, and confirmed the protein expression in chondrocytes isolated from New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits . Among the 3 baculovirus vectors, only the BMP-2-expressing baculovirus (designated Bac-CB) remarkably enhanced the aggrecan and collagen II production by partially de-differentiated passage 3 (P3) cells and restored the differentiation. The baculovirus expressing TGF-β1 (designated Bac-CT) modestly augmented the chondrogenesis but was insufficient to reverse the de-differentiation status of P3 cells . Nonetheless, co-transduction of de-differentiated P3 chondrocytes with Bac-CB and Bac-CT synergistically modulated the re-differentiation program (Sung et al., 2009) . Albeit the chondrogenic potential, Bac-CB transduction alone was insufficient to support uniform 3D cartilage growth in the static culture due to the lack of mechanical stimulation and poor oxygen/ nutrient transfer. To tackle these problems, P3 chondrocytes transduced with Bac-CB were seeded into PLGA scaffolds and cultured in a rotating-shaft bioreactor (RSB), which grew into cartilage-like tissues after 3-week dynamic culture . Implantation of the engineered cartilages into the osteochondral defects of NZW rabbits resulted in the regeneration of hyaline cartilages at week 8 and improved the integration of the host and engineered cartilages (Chen et al., 2009c) . Massive segmental bony defects often occur following trauma or tumor resection and remain a clinical problem. For bone regeneration, BMSCs have evolved to be a promising cell source as they are immunoprivileged, immunosuppressive and capable of differentiating into osteoblasts . In this regard, baculovirus transduces BMSCs with efficiencies exceeding ≈95% under optimized conditions ), but the transduction efficiencies for BMSCs-derived progenitors varies widely with the differentiation states at which the committed progenitors are transduced Lee et al., 2007b) . Furthermore, transduction of human BMSCs with Bac-CB (which expresses the potent osteogenic factor BMP-2) directed in vitro commitment of naïve BMSCs into osteoblasts (Chuang et al., 2007) . After injection into the back subcutis of immunodeficient nude mice, the transduced BMSCs resulted in progressive mineralization and ectopic bone formation (Chuang et al., 2007) . Implantation of the Bac-CB-engineered human BMSCs into rat calvarial defects stimulated mineralized bone matrix deposition and initiated the bone island formation at week 4, but without immunosuppression the xenogeneic cells were rejected and eradicated at week 12 (Chuang et al., 2010) . To circumvent the rejection, BMSCs isolated from NZW rabbits were used for baculovirus transduction and allotransplantation. Given the important roles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in angiogenesis, ossification and callus maturation, rabbit BMSCs were transduced with Bac-CV (expressing VEGF) or Bac-CB, mixed at a number ratio of 1:4, seeded into PLGA scaffolds and implanted to the critical-size (10 mm in length) femoral segmental defects of allogeneic, immunocompetent NZW rabbits, which represent a fairly rigorous bone healing scenario (Lin et al., 2010a ). X-ray radiography, positron emission tomography (PET), micro computed tomography (μCT), immunohistochemical staining and biomechanical testing illustrated that the baculovirus-engineered cell/scaffold constructs not only accelerated the bone healing, but also gave rise to prominent angiogenesis and improved mechanical properties at week 8. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are another promising cell source for regenerative medicine thanks to the ease of isolation in abundance and capacity of osteogenic differentiation (Levi et al., 2010) . However, ASCs appear to be inferior to BMSCs in osteogenic differentiation and ASCs engineered by the conventional baculovirus transiently expressing BMP-2/VEGF (S group) led to significantly poorer healing of segmental femoral bone defects than BMSCs engineered by the same vectors (Fig. 2) . To use ASCs for repairing large, segmental bone defects, we surmised that sustained expression of factors promoting osteogenesis (BMP-2) and angiogenesis (VEGF) are necessary. As such, we employed a hybrid baculovirus system developed previously for persistent expression . The dual vector system constitutes two baculoviruses whereby one expresses the flippase recombination enzyme (FLP) while the other accommodates the BMP-2 or VEGF cassette flanked by the flippase recognition target (Frt) sequences. Within the mammalian cells cotransduced with the hybrid baculoviruses, FLP catalyzes the recombination of the Frt-flanking cassette, resulting in the cassette excision off the baculovirus genome, formation of episomal circle and substantially prolonged transgene expression . Likewise, the FLP/Frt-mediated recombination occurred efficiently in the NZW rabbit ASCs, enabling persistent transgene expression for N28 days . Allotransplantation of the NZW rabbit ASCs transduced with the hybrid baculoviruses expressing BMP-2/VEGF into the critical-size femoral segmental defects accelerated the healing, improved the bone quality and angiogenesis when compared with transplanting ASCs engineered with the conventional baculoviruses (Fig. 2) . Therefore, ASCs engineered by the hybrid baculovirus vector hold promise for repairing massive segmental defects . The safety profile of the hybrid baculovirus vectors was recently assessed using human BMSCs as the host (Chen et al., 2011a) . Transduction of human BMSCs with the hybrid baculovirus neither compromised the cell viability/differentiation, nor resulted in transgene integration into the host chromosome. The transduction did not disrupt the BMSCs karyotype, nor did it disturb the expression of wellknown proto-oncogenes (c-myc, N-ras, K-ras and H-ras) and tumor suppressor genes (p53 and p16). Furthermore, the transduced BMSCs did not induce tumor formation in nude mice. These data altogether ensure the safe use of the FLP/Frt-based hybrid vector for stem cell engineering and tissue regeneration. As discussed in Section 2.3, wild-type baculovirus triggers the innate immunity and potentiates the adaptive immune responses, which protect the animals from the infection of several viruses. These attributes have sparked explosive interests to develop baculovirus as a vector vaccine candidate, in which the antigens can be (1) expressed by the vector within the host cells, (2) displayed on the baculovirus surface or (3) displayed and expressed by the vector (Table 2) . The feasibility of using baculovirus as a vaccine expression vector was first tested by in vivo inoculation of the baculovirus expressing the glycoprotein gB of pseudorabies virus (Aoki et al., 1999) or hemagglutinin (HA) of H1N1 influenza virus (Abe et al., 2003) into mice, which raised antigen-specific antibody. Moreover, baculovirus expressing the E2 glycoprotein of HCV or carcinoembryonic antigen could elicit antigen-specific T cell responses (Facciabene et al., 2004) . Similarly, subcutaneous (s.c.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) immunizations of mice with a baculovirus expressing the antigens of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induced humoral immune responses and Th1-biased cellular immunity (Bai et al., 2008) . The efficacy of baculovirus-based vaccines has been potentiated by surface display of VSVG protein on the envelope. The VSVGpseudotyped baculovirus expressing the GP5 and M proteins of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) under the CMV promoter elicited anti-PRRSV neutralizing antibodies and IFN-γ, and conferred better immunogenicity than the DNA vaccine expressing the same antigens . Conversely, i.m. immunizations of a mixture of VSVG-pseudotyped baculovirus expressing pseudorabies virus (PRV) proteins triggered Th1-biased immune responses, as manifested by the induction of IFN-γ and PRVspecific IgG2a antibodies (Grabowska et al., 2009) . The immunization also provoked NK cell activity (accompanied by the production of IFN-α and IFN-γ) and protected mice against lethal PRV challenge. I. m. immunization of chickens with another VSVG-pseudotyped baculovirus expressing HA of H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) also evoked significantly higher levels of H5-specific antibody and cellular immunity than those receiving DNA vaccines, and conferred protection against lethal challenge with the homologous virus strain (Wu et al., 2009b) . Similar VSVG-pseudotyped baculovirus vectors have been constructed to express the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) envelope protein (Li et al., 2009b) , the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) (Fan et al., 2008) , and the Toxoplasma gondii SAG1 protein . All these studies showed that i.m. immunization of the VSVG-pseudotyped baculovirus vector results in stronger vaccine effects than the DNA vaccine counterparts, which can be attributable to the adjuvant properties of baculovirus and more efficient transduction of muscle cells in vivo. The effective transduction of muscle cells is desired as the chance of antigen presentation to DCs is increased and baculovirus-mediated expression is considerably prolonged in myogenic cells (Shen et al., 2008) . Note, however, that VSVG pseudotyping induces cytotoxicity and impairs the baculovirus titer, hence a truncated version of VSVG comprised of the 21 amino acid ectodomain, the transmembrane and CTD domains was designed for baculovirus pseudotyping (Kaikkonen et al., 2006) . The truncated VSVG reduced the cytotoxicity and was exploited to construct two pseudotyped baculoviruses: one expressing the capsid protein of footand-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and the other encoding the capsid and a T-cell immunogen . I.m. inoculation of the Fig. 2 . The ASCs engineered with the hybrid baculovirus augment the healing of massive bone defects. The NZW rabbit ASCs were transduced with the hybrid baculovirus vectors conferring sustained expression of BMP-2 or VEGF, mixed at a number ratio of 4:1, loaded into cylindrical PLGA scaffolds (1.5 × 10 6 cells/scaffold) and implanted to the critical-size segmental defects at the femora of NZW rabbits (2 constructs/defect, designated L group). The S group contained ASCs that were transduced with conventional baculoviruses transiently expressing BMP-2/VEGF and implanted in a similar fashion. The Mock group comprised the mock-transduced ASCs as the negative control. X-ray radiography, gross appearance examination, micro computed tomography (μCT), hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and CD 31-specific immunohistochemical staining (to detect blood vessel formation) performed at 12 weeks post-implantation collectively demonstrated that the L group (persistently expressing BMP-2 and VEGF) resulted in significantly improved bone healing and angiogenesis in comparison with the S group (transiently expressing BMP-2 and VEGF) and Mock group. Stars indicate the new bone while arrows indicate the blood vessel formation. baculoviruses into mice induced the FMDV-specific neutralizing antibodies and IFN-γ, and expression of the additional T-cell immunogen augmented the immunogenicity. Besides VSVG, human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) envelope protein was used for pseudotyping the baculovirus (designated AcHERV-HP16L1) that encoded the L1 capsid protein of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV 16) (Lee et al., 2010) . After i.m. injection and 2 booster injections at 2-week intervals, the mice developed similarly high levels of IgG, IgA and neutralization titers, as well as tremendously higher levels of IFN-γ when compared with the mice immunized with the commercial virus-like particle vaccine Gardasil ® (25 μL/dose). Thus AcHERV-HP16L1 holds promise as a cost-effective and efficient HPV vaccine. As mentioned in Section 3.1, surface display of heterologous protein/peptide has been achieved by fusion with gp64 gene and expression driven by either polyhedrin or p10 promoter. Taking advantage of this technology, baculovirus displaying the rodent malaria Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein (PbCSP) (Yoshida et al., 2003) , the antigenic site A of FMDV VP1 protein (Tami et al., 2004) or the SARS-CoV spike protein (Chang et al., 2004; Feng et al., 2006) has been shown to induce potent immune responses. More recently, baculovirus vectors displaying the Pfs25 protein of Plasmodium falciparum (Mlambo et al., 2010) and 19-kDa carboxyl terminus of merozoite surface protein 1 (PyMSP1 19 ) of Plasmodium yoelii were also developed as potential vaccines against malaria. I.m. and intranasal (i.n) immunizations of mice with the PyMSP1 19 -displaying baculovirus induced mixed Th1/Th2-type immune responses, but i.n. immunization yielded higher PyMSP119-specific antibody titers and natural boosting after challenge. I.n. immunization also conferred complete protection thanks to the Th1/Th2-type immunity associated with TLR9-dependent pathway . HA protein is the major antigen of influenza virus and, similar to gp64, is a class I transmembrane protein on the viral envelope. gp64based fusion was harnessed to display the HA of AIV using the CTD derived from HA or from gp64 (Yang et al., 2007) . In comparison with the HA CTD, gp64 CTD endowed more efficient HA display and stimulated stronger hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers crucial for neutralizing the live AIV (Yang et al., 2007) . The profound effect of gp64 CTD on HA display was attested in a recent study which delineated that the signal peptide and CTD of gp64 could enhance the display of influenza HA on baculovirus surface, while the gp64 transmembrane domain impaired HA display (Tang et al., 2010) . Based on the finding, a baculovirus simultaneously displaying 4 HAs derived from 4 subclades of H5N1 AIV was constructed. I.m. immunization of mice with this tetravalent baculovirus elicited HI titers against all 4 homologous H5N1 viruses, significantly reduced viral lung titers of challenged mice, raised high levels of IFN-γsecreting and HA-specific CD8+ T cells, and provided 100% protection against lethal challenge with homologous H5N1 viruses (Tang et al., 2010) . The same design concept exploiting the gp64 CTD was also adopted to display the σC and σB proteins of avian reovirus (Lin et al., 2008) , E rns envelope glycoprotein , E2 (Xu and Liu, 2008) or NS3 protein (Xu et al., 2009 ) of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and the E glycoprotein of JEV (Xu et al., 2011) . These studies collectively attested that the antigen can be efficiently displayed on the baculoviral envelope and induce humoral/cellular immune responses against the lethal viral challenge. Other than displaying the antigen via genetic engineering, CD4+ T helper epitope (SFERFEIPKE) and the major B cell epitope (WLTEKEGSYP) derived from the HA of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 have also been chemically conjugated to baculovirus envelope (Wilson et al., 2008) . I.n. administration of such baculovirus to mice elicited antigen-specific IgG1a/IgG2a, IgA and IFN-γ, thus chemical coupling allows for the delivery of multiple epitopes to baculovirus. In addition, HA of AIV (H5N1) has been displayed on another baculovirus Bombyx mori NPV (BmNPV) via fusion with gp64 (Jin et al., 2008) . The virus was produced and purified from silkworm pupae infected with the recombinant virus. Immunization of rhesus monkeys with aluminum hydroxide as the adjuvant at doses of 2 mg/kg and 0.67 mg/kg elicited neutralizing antibodies and protected monkeys against influenza virus challenge. The vaccine did not cause appreciable toxicity at the dose as large as 3.2 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys and 1.6 mg/kg in mice, indicating the safe vaccine doses (Jin et al., 2008) .

Baculovirus as a dual vector for antigen expression/display It is perceivable that the antigen-expressing baculovirus mimicks the DNA vaccine. Following vector injection into the hosts, the antigen is expressed and presented via MHC I pathway in the transduced cells, and activates CD8+ T cells. Conversely, the antigen-displaying baculovirus mimicks the subunit vaccine. Antigens on the envelope are internalized by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and DCs, and presented by the MHC II pathway to stimulate humoral immune responses. To fully exploit both mechanisms, a dual baculovirus vector that simultaneously displays and expresses the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein was developed as a human malaria vaccine (Strauss et al., 2007) . This vector contained two expression cassettes, one encoding the CS-gp64 fusion protein under the polyhedrin promoter while the other accommodating the CS gene under the CMV promoter, such that CS can be displayed on the envelope and expressed after transduction into mammalian cells. Upon i.m. injection into mice, the dual vector induced higher anti-CS antibody titers and higher frequencies of CS-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells than the vectors that only displayed or only expressed CS. Recently, we adopted a similar approach and constructed 3 vectors: Bac-HA64 harbored the HA gene of AIV under the p10 promoter for HA display; Bac-CHA expressed HA under the CMV promoter while the dual vector Bac-CHA/HA64 encompassed both expression cassettes in opposite orientations, such that Bac-CHA/ HA64 displayed and expressed HA in the transduced cells . All 3 vectors, after administration (i.m., i.n. and s.c.) into BALB/c mice, provoked HA-specific humoral (IgG1, IgG2a and HI titers), mucosal (IgA titers) and cellular (IFN-γ and IL-4 producing T cells and IFN-γ + /CD8 + T cells) immune responses. The strong cellular immunity provoked by Bac-HA64, which in theory favors the MHC II pathway and preferentially elicits humoral immune responses, was likely due to the potent adjuvant effects of baculovirus. Regardless, via either administration route the dual vector Bac-CHA/HA64 triggered superior or at least comparable HA-specific immune responses than the other two vaccine forms, demonstrating the advantages of the dual form for vaccine design . Instead of using two separate cassettes as above, Yoshida et al. (2009) devised a single cassette system whereby the PbCSP-gp64 fusion gene was driven by a tandem promoter consisting of the CMV and polyhedrin promoters, so that PbCSP was expressed in insect cells and mammalian cells. I.m. immunization with this baculovirus elicited both Th1 and Th2 responses as evidenced by the high PbCSP-specific IgG1/ IgG2a titers and PbCSP-specific CD8+ T-cells responses, and conferred 100% protection against sporozoite challenge (Yoshida et al. 2009 ). The same dual expression system was subsequently utilized to express Plasmodium vivax transmission-blocking immunogen (Pvs25) for the development of malarial transmission-blocking vaccines against the sexual stages of the parasite (Blagborough et al., 2010) . Both i.n. and i.m. immunizations of mice induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response as evidenced by high Pvs25-specific IgG1 and IgG2a/IgG2b titers as well as a strong transmission-blocking response after challenge. Another simple approach to developing the dual vector is to drive the antigen expression using the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) ie1 promoter, which is active in insect, mammalian and avian cells (Gao et al., 2007; He et al., 2008) . Baculovirus encoding the WSSV VP28 envelope protein driven by the WSSV ie1 promoter was able to display VP28 on the envelope (Syed Musthaq et al., 2009) . Immunization of shrimp with this baculovirus resulted in VP28 expression in shrimp tissues, elevated the survival rate and reduced the WSSV viral load after WSSV infection. WSSV ie1 promoter was also used in conjunction with VSVG pseudotyping. I.m. injection of the VSVG-pseudotyped baculovirus that expressed the E2 protein of CSFV under the ie1 promoter induced CSFV-specific neutralizing antibodies and lymphoproliferative responses in mice (Li et al., 2009a) . WSSV ie1 promoter has been most extensively employed by the Kwang group to drive the expression of HA of H5N1 AIV, which enabled HA display on the envelope and conferred the viral particle hemagglutination activity . I.m. injection of this vector (designated BacHA) into mice elicited the antibodies with HI titers against the tested influenza virus. In Sf-9 cells, WSSV ie1 promoter was more active than CMV promoter, thereby giving rise to more efficient HA incorporation into the baculoviral envelope . The ie1 promoter also resulted in strong HA expression in the lung (after i.n. inoculation) and thymus (after i.m. inoculation) in chickens. As a result, immunization of chickens with the baculovirus bearing the ie1 promoter (BacHA) elicited higher anti-HA antibody levels than that bearing the CMV promoter . However, i.n. inoculation of BacHA stimulated low anti-HA IgG titers (Prabakaran et al., 2008) . To enhance the vaccine efficacy via the i.n. route, BacHA was co-administered with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (rCTB) as the adjuvant, which significantly enhanced the serum IgG, mucosal IgA and serum microneutralization titers. With the adjuvant, BacHA also triggered higher HA-specific humoral and mucosal immune responses than the inactivated H5N1 virus adjuvanted with the same dose of rCTB, and conferred complete protection against challenge with homologous and heterologous H5N1 strains (Prabakaran et al., 2008) . Additionally, gastrointestinal delivery of BacHA into mice by oral gavage led to transduction in vivo and remarkably boosted the HA-specific IgG, HI and mucosal IgA titers (Prabakaran et al., 2010c) . The live BacHA triggered stronger cross-clade neutralization against heterologous H5N1 strains than the inactivated BacHA, and provided 100% protection against challenge with lethal doses of homologous and heterologous H5N1. Moreover, after challenge the immunized mice exhibited only minimal bronchitis in lungs and regained their body weight more rapidly (Prabakaran et al., 2010c) . The oral vaccine efficacy was further potentiated by encapsulating the live BacHA within a reverse micelle structure of phosphatidylcholine, which provided protection against the destructive environment in the intestinal lumen (Prabakaran et al., 2010b) . In comparison with the non-encapsulated BacHA, gastrointestinal delivery of the encapsulated baculovirus into mice led to significantly ameliorated HA-specific IgG and IgA responses, and higher HI titers. The encapsulated vaccine induced strong cross-clade neutralization titers against heterologous H5N1 strains and conferred protection against infection with highly pathogenic, heterologous H5N1 viruses (Prabakaran et al., 2010b) . Using the same WSSV ie1 approach, more recently Kwang and coworkers selected 3 HA proteins from different vaccine strains for expression and display on the baculovirus surface (Prabakaran et al., 2010a) . The 3 HA proteins covered the entire variants in the neutralizing epitopes among the H5N1 lineages. S.c. immunization of mice with a mixture of 3 baculoviruses displaying the 3 HA proteins (tri-BacHA) induced antibodies capable of neutralizing viruses from clades 1, 2.1, 2.2, 4, 7, and 8 of H5N1 viruses. In contrast, s.c. immunization with a single HA-displaying baculovirus (mono-BacHA) or a single strain of inactivated whole virus vaccine neutralized only clade 1 (homologous), clade 2.1, and clade 8.0 viruses. Also, the tri-BacHA vaccine protected 100% of the mice against challenge with three different clades (clades 1.0, 2.1, and 7.0) of H5N1 viruses. Since the discovery in 1995 that baculovirus effectively transduces mammalian cells and mediates transgene expression, baculovirus has emerged as a promising gene delivery vector. Albeit the rapidly growing lists of permissive cells and applications, relatively little is known about what happens inside the cells after baculovirus transduction. Evidence accumulating in recent years has indicated that after entry, baculovirus can translocate into the nucleus through a complex cascade of steps and express baculoviral genes and the transgene. The entire process results in the recognition of baculovirus by the cells via the TLR9-dependent and -independent pathways, and disturbs the expression of a small percentage of host genes, particularly those pertaining to the innate immune responses. However, disparity does exist between reports and the exact intracellular events remain elusive. The lack of comprehensive knowledge about the events governing the virus entry, intracellular transport and cellular responses will constitute a roadblock to future applications in the clinical setting, thus entailing extensive research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Although the innate immune responses stir up concerns regarding the safety of baculovirus in gene therapy, these responses represent opportunities to harness baculovirus as a vector to defend against infectious agents and tumors. Indeed, baculovirus-based vaccine has captured explosive interests over the past 3 years and in one case has entered into trials in primates (Jin et al., 2008) . Thanks to the intrinsic adjuvant properties, in most studies baculovirus-based vaccines were able to trigger potent immune responses in the absence of additional adjuvants. Due to the widespread use and encouraging preclinical data in comparison with other vaccine forms (e.g. DNA vaccine, viruslike particle vaccine and whole virus vaccine), it is envisioned that baculovirus-based vaccines can progress into next phase in the near future. The capability of shRNA/miRNA delivery also confers baculovirus an edge for target gene regulation and for future applications in antiviral therapy and immunotherapy. Furthermore, baculovirus transduction of neural cells (Kenoutis et al., 2006) and adult stem cells (Bak et al., 2010; Ho et al., 2006; Zeng et al., 2009) does not markedly alter the inherent properties and mitigate the differentiation capacity, warranting baculovirus a promising vector for cell therapy and tissue engineering. Recent progresses in the baculovirus vectors engineering with respect to surface modification, minimization of in vivo inactivation, transgene targeting and prolongation of expression further corroborate the potentials of baculovirus in these applications. To advance the baculovirus technology from bench to bedside, other roadblocks still stand in the way. Over the past few years, a wealth of literature has addressed the problems in baculoviral vector production Carinhas et al., 2009 Carinhas et al., , 2010 Dojima et al., 2010; Tsai et al., 2007) , quantification (Chan et al., 2006; Ferris et al., 2011; Kärkkäinen et al., 2009; Lo et al., 2011; Lo and Chao, 2004; Roldao et al., 2009) , purification (Chen et al., 2009a; Kaikkonen et al., 2008; Transfiguracion et al., 2007; Vicente et al., 2009 Vicente et al., , 2010a Vicente et al., , 2010b Wu et al., 2007) and quality assurance (Ihalainen et al., 2010; Jorio et al., 2006) . New baculoviral vectors taking advantage of hybrid promoters (Gao et al., 2007; Keil et al., 2009; Lackner et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2009) and new regulatory elements (Du et al., 2010; Mahonen et al., 2007) are also being developed and evaluated for their potential applications. Additionally, the transduction conditions (Keil et al., 2009; Pan et al., 2009) , supplements (Guo et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2010) and parameters (Lee et al., 2007a (Lee et al., , 2007b Shen et al., 2007 Shen et al., , 2008 dictating the transduction efficiencies have been evaluated. These technological progresses undoubtedly will facilitate the production of baculoviral vectors in compliance of cGMP regulations, and advance baculovirus from a research tool to clinical applications.    1\n",
       "Since its isolation as a novel virus in 2011, cases of the acute infectious disease called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) [1] have risen rapidly in China, Japan, and Korea, posing a risk to public health and increasing the fear of ticks that transmit the deadly SFTS virus (SFTSV). From 2011 to 2016, this emerging tick-borne virus infected 5,360 people in China with an average case fatality rate of 6.40% [2] . After initial reports in 2013 of sporadic SFTS cases in South Korea [3] and Japan [4] , South Korea reported 605 cases with an average case fatality of 20.9% [5] and Japan reported 310 cases with an average fatality of 19.4% [6] from 2013 to 2017. Ticks such as Haemaphysalis longicornis and Rhipicephalus microplus are implicated as the prominent vectors for transmitting SFTSV [7] . With regards to SFTSV hosts, various vertebrate species are considered to have been infected, as evidenced by high SFTSV seroprevalence in domestic animals in SFTS endemic regions [8, 9] . Additionally, reported cases of human-tohuman transmission through contact with blood or body fluid, including infections in healthcare workers from patients, pose a further threat to the public [10, 11] . Furthermore, the discovery of H. longicornis tick in the United States indicates the possibility that SFTSV could spread to other continents, highlighting the need to prevent disease transmission [12] . SFTSV is a single-stranded negative-sense tripartite RNA virus that is classified as a member of the Phlebovirus genus, Phenuiviridae family, and Bunyaviriales order. The genome of SFTSV is comprised of L, M, and S segments, which encode the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L segment), envelope Gn glycoprotein (M segment), envelope Gc glycoprotein (M segment), nucleoprotein (S segment), and nonstructural proteins (S segment) [13] . A phylogenetic analysis based on genome sequences of SFTSV isolates found substantial genetic diversity and accumulated mutations, suggesting that SFTSV has existed for decades at minimum [14, 15] . However, the difference in virulence between these SFTSV sub-lineages has yet to be determined. The major clinical features of SFTS include high fever (body temperature �38˚C), fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and abdominal pain [16, 17] . In severe cases, SFTS can include central nervous system manifestations, hemorrhagic signs, and multiple organ dysfunction, which can lead to death [18] [19] [20] [21] . No vaccines or therapeutics specific for SFTS have been approved for human use. Recently, a Phase 3 clinical trial of favipiravir (Avigan), a drug approved for the treatment of influenza virus infection in Japan, was initiated to expand its indication to SFTS treatment [22] . Monoclonal antibodies or convalescent sera from SFTS patients were tested to identify potential therapeutic intervention targets, resulting in the identification of SFTSV glycoproteins as molecules required for host cell entry [23, 24] and also as critical targets for virus neutralization through the development of humoral immunity. Both the Gn and Gc envelope glycoproteins of SFTSV are type I transmembrane proteins, and Gc is proposed to be a membrane fusion protein critical for SFTSV infection [25] . This has also been shown in Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) [26] , which is a well-known phlebovirus, whereas the function of Gn remains largely elusive across all other species in the genus Phlebovirus. The structure of the Gn head domain, which is composed of three subdomains, was resolved in SFTSV and RVFV [27] . However, the homology and arrangement within subdomains differ considerably between the two viruses, and the structure of the Gn stem domain still remains unknown. Moreover, the generation of an antibody for these targets in infected humans is rare, due to the presence of immunodominant decoy epitopes in the nucleoprotein [28] , which is a common phenomenon in a pathogenic virus-infected host [29] . In animal models, however, the protective effect of human convalescent sera was shown, suggesting that antibody therapy is possible [30] . Thus far, MAb4-5 is the only human neutralizing monoclonal antibody reported, and it was developed using a combinatorial human antibody library from five patients [31] . MAb4-5 binds to domain III of SFTSV Gn glycoprotein [27] . The neutralizing effect of MAb4-5 has been shown only in in vitro, and its in vivo efficacy remains to be shown. In this study, we constructed an antibody library from a patient who recovered from SFTS and selected antibodies against the Gn and Gc glycoproteins. Among these antibodies, Ab10 bound to Gn glycoprotein and showed a potent neutralizing effect in vitro and protective effect in vivo. In addition, we characterized the conformational epitope of Ab10 using crosslinking coupled mass spectrometry and by testing its reactivity to alanine mutants, which allowed us to estimate the strain coverage of Ab10. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells, we produced Gn and Gc glycoproteins fused with a crystallizable fragment of the human immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain constant region (Gn-Fc and Gc-Fc) or those fused with the human Ig kappa light chain constant region (Gn-Cκ and Gc-Cκ) and then purified the proteins by affinity chromatography. We constructed the phage-displayed single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody library with a complexity of 1.3 × 10 9 colony forming units using peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a patient who had recovered from SFTS. The phage-display antibody library with a coverage level of 730× was subjected to four rounds of biopanning against either the recombinant Gn-Fc or the Gc-Fc fusion proteins conjugated to paramagnetic beads. We randomly selected phagemid clones from the output titer plate from the last round of biopanning and subjected these clones to phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To minimize the number of clones reactive to the Fc portion of fusion proteins, Gn-Cκ and Gc-Cκ were used as antigens. Positive clones were selected and subjected to Sanger sequencing to determine the scFv nucleotide sequence. We identified five clones reactive to Gn and five clones reactive to Gc. All of these scFv clones were expressed as a scFv antibody fused with Fc (scFv-Fc) in HEK293F cells and purified by affinity. We tested 10 antibodies for their ability to reduce cytopathic effects (CPE) caused by SFTSV (S1 Fig). One anti-Gn antibody, designated as Ab10, was extremely effective at neutralizing SFTSV, as shown by a reduction in the percentage of cells showing CPE from 90% to 10%. In the focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), Ab10 also showed significantly higher potency compared to the other candidate antibodies (S2 Fig). The V H sequences of Ab10 had a 95.9% shared identity with the IGHV3-30 � 18 germline, excluding the heavy chain complementary determining region (HCDR) 3, whereas the V κ sequence had 86.3% shared identity with the IGKV1-39 � 01 germline (S3 Fig) . In an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using Vero cells and an anti-Gn antibody, we determined the proportion of Gn glycoprotein producing cells, which were infected with SFTSV, to measure the neutralizing potency of Ab10. Only 5.6 ± 2.8% (mean ± s.d.) of Vero cells produced Gn glycoprotein when Ab10 was administered at a concentration of 50 μg/mL (956 nM) (Fig 1) . When MAb4-5 antibody was applied at the same concentration, 77.8 ± 18.0% of the cells produced Gn glycoprotein. When cells were not protected by any antibody, all cells produced Gn glycoprotein and cells not incubated with SFTSV did not produce Gn glycoprotein. To measure neutralizing efficacy, Ab10 scFv-Fc fusion protein was mixed with 100 TCID 50 of SFTSV (strain: Gangwon/Korea/2012) and added to Vero cells. After incubation for 1 h, the cells were washed and cultured for 2 days. Then, the Gn glycoprotein produced in infected Vero cells was detected in an immunofluorescence assay using anti-SFTSV Gn glycoprotein antibody, which did not compete with Ab10 in its binding, with at least five technical replicates. The fluorescence signal intensity of stained SFTSV Gn glycoprotein was used as a quantitative indicator for viral infection. (A) The proportion of infected cells compared to non-treated cells was defined as relative cell infection (%) and was plotted. Mab4-5 scFv-Fc fusion protein was also treated in a parallel experiment. Error bars represent standard deviations (s.d.), asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference as determined by a nonparametric Friedman test with a post hoc Dunn's multiple comparison test ( � P � 0.05, �� P � 0.01, ��� P � 0.001, ���� P � 0.0001). (B) Representative images of each treatment group are shown (scale bar, 100 μm). SFTSV Gn glycoprotein and nuclei were stained with FITC (green) and DAPI (blue), respectively.  For the animal study, the lethal dose of the Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain of SFTSV was determined in type I interferon (interferon α/β) receptor gene (IFNAR1)-deficient A129 mice (n = 4 per group). The mice were subcutaneously injected with a dose of either 20 or 2 × Using the antibody protection model, A129 mice (n = 5 per group) were subcutaneously injected with the Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain of SFTSV at a dose of either 2 or 20 PFU. After 1 h, mice were intraperitoneally administered with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Ab10, MAb4-5, or a human IgG 1 isotope control antibody at a dose of 600 μg (approximately corresponding to 30 mg/kg of body weight); for 4 days at 24 h intervals, the injection of the same amount of antibody was performed (Fig 2A) . In the groups treated with PBS or an isotype control antibody, all mice died within 7 days at both viral doses (Fig 2B and 2C ). At 4 d.p.i. with a dose of 2 PFU, approximately 10% of body weight was lost; at 3 d.p.i. with 20 PFU, 10-15% of body weight was lost. All mice treated with Ab10 survived both viral doses and did not have any weight loss. With MAb4-5 treatment, death occurred in all mice treated with a 2 PFU viral dose and in 80% of mice treated with a 20 PFU dose. Significant weight losses were also observed in all these mice. In the delayed treatment model, the antibody treatment started from 1, 3, 4, or 5 d.p.i. and continued for 4 consecutive days (Fig 3A) . At a 2 PFU viral dose, all mice survived when treatments with Ab10 were delayed until 3 d.p.i., and 80% survived when the treatments were delayed until 4 or 5 d.p.i. (Fig 3B and 3C ). Mice not treated until 4 d.p.i. had significant weight loss. At a 20 PFU viral dose, delaying Ab10 antibody treatment until 1 or 3 d.p.i. protected all or 80% of mice, respectively. Mice with treatment delayed until 1 d.p.i. did not lose weight, whereas mice with treatment delayed until 3 d.p.i. lost 8% of their body weight. When treatment was delayed until 4 d.p.i. or later, all the mice died. To check the reactivity of Ab10 to SFTSV strains other than Gangwon/Korea/2012, we overexpressed and purified recombinant Gn glycoproteins of other SFTSV strains. Binding of Ab10 to intact virus particles was also confirmed using an ELISA with a virus-coated microtiter plate (S5 Fig) . Among the 272 SFTSV strain sequences deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR), we selected the strains HB29, AH15, SD4, and YG1, each belong to different clusters (S6 Fig), to compare their reactivity with well-known virus isolates from China and Japan. We successfully overexpressed Gn glycoprotein from HB29 and SD4 as a Fc fusion protein and subjected these proteins to ELISAs. Ab10 IgG 1 successfully bound to Gn glycoproteins from the HB29 and SD4 strains in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 10 pM to 1 nM ( Fig 4A) . Additionally, the amount of antibody bound to the HB29 and SD4 Gn glycoproteins coated on the ELISA plate was higher than that of the Gangwon/Korea/2012 glycoproteins, at most of the tested concentrations. We also found that MAb4-5 was reactive to Gn glycoprotein from the HB29 and SD4 strains ( Fig 4B) . We used surface plasmon resonance analyses to determine the kinetics of Ab10 binding to the Gn glycoprotein of Gangwon/Korea/2012. Ab10 bound to Gn glycoprotein with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) of 104 pM and with an association rate (k on ) of 7.4 × 10 5 M -1 s -1 and a dissociation rate (k off ) of 7.7 × 10 −5 s -1 (Fig 4C) . In an immunoblot analysis using recombinant Gn glycoprotein from the Gangwon/Korea/ 2012 strain, Ab10 did not react to Gn glycoprotein, whereas some other anti-Gn antibodies To discover the site where Ab10 binds, we performed crosslinking coupled mass spectrometry using a deuterium isotope-labeled homo-bifunctional linker, which forms covalent bonds between amino acid residues within the interface of the antibody-antigen complex as described previously [32] . We found that cross-linkers bound to five amino acid residues (318Y, 324R, 326K, 328Y, and 331S) within domain II of the SFTSV Gn glycoprotein and also to four amino acid residues (371K, 372S, 379H, and 383S) within the stem region ( Fig 5A) . Based on this observation, we prepared several alanine-replacement mutants that spanned from 315V to 389K, and tested their reactivity to Ab10 using ELISAs. All the mutants were An anti-Gn glycoprotein antibody from a convalescent patient inhibits the infection of SFTSV expressed with an HA peptide at the carboxy terminus and the tags were used to measure the relative amount of each mutant. Alanine mutant proteins were captured by the Ab10 antibody, which was coated on the ELISA plate. Then, we measured the amount of captured mutant proteins by detecting the Fc portion of protein. The signals detected by capturing the HA peptide were used to normalize expression of mutant proteins. We measured the reactivity of Ab10 to alanine mutant Gn proteins, relative to wild type Gn glycoprotein, and found that alanine replacement of the amino acid residues in domain II from V315 to M334 resulted in reduced relative reactivity of Ab10 by more than 60%, except for S317, G319, and M321. This finding was consistent with our results deduced from the crosslinking coupled mass spectrometry ( Fig  5A and 5B ). In the stem region, replacing the cystine residues (C349, C356, C376, and C381) reduced the relative reactivity by more than 80%. This observation was consistent with a previous report that the structural stability of Gn was disrupted by a C356A mutation [27] . Also, mutation of the flanking residues of cystine, corresponding to G351, L354, E355, I357, T374, and V375 also reduced the reactivity by over 60%. Of the mutated residues that were distant from cysteine residues, mutation of G360, V361, R362, L363, T365, L370, G387, and K389 residues reduced the relative reactivity by more than 80%. The other mutations had minor effects on reactivity. Overall, Ab10 binding to Gn was predicted to be affected by 25 amino acid residues within domain II and the stem region of SFTSV Gn glycoprotein. Given that Gn glycoproteins from 247 isolates have conserved sequences for these 25 amino acid residues, we expect that Ab10 can react with 90.8% (247 out of 272) of SFTSV isolates currently reported (S8 Fig) . Antibodies play a pivotal role in preventing viral entry into cells and can induce lysis of infected cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity [33] [34] [35] . Polysera from recovered patients or from vaccinated donors have been used as prophylactic agents for various viral diseases, including hepatitis B and rabies [36] . As an alternative approach, virus-directed monoclonal antibodies have also been developed and tested as therapies or as prophylaxis for viral diseases. Palivizumab (Synagis) was marketapproved for the prophylaxis of RSV in 1998. In addition, antibodies against HIV [37] [38] [39] , RSV [40] , Ebola virus [41] and influenza virus [42, 43] demonstrated potent efficacy in animal models. Antibodies targeting emerging or re-emerging viruses including MERS-CoV [44] [45] [46] and Zika virus [47] [48] [49] were also developed and are being tested in clinical trials. In the past several decades, antibodies have become one of the major therapeutic agents for cancer and autoimmune disease with indications that have rapidly broadened in recent years. Recent technical improvements in the discovery and manufacturing steps of therapeutic antibody production have also allowed rapid and successful antibody development to combat emerging infectious diseases [50] . Until now, SFTS patients have been reported from China, South Korea, and Japan, and the number of patients has increased each year [2, 5, 6] . However, SFTS fatality varies among the three countries [21] . The average case fatality rate in China from 2011 to 2016 was 6.40% [2] . Those in South Korea and Japan after 2013 were much higher; 20.9% [5] and 19.4% [6] , respectively. In the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR), 272 sequences of SFTSV isolates are currently deposited. However, it is unknown if there is any significant variability in the virulence of these isolates. Previous reports showed that mice died 5 to 7 days after infection with 10 6 focus forming units (FFU) of the YG1 strain [30] or 10 6 TCID 50 of the SPL010 strain [51] . Based on these observations, we first inoculated A129 mice with 2 × 10 5 PFU of the Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain and observed that all mice died 4 days after infection. With a 20 PFU dose of the Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain, mice died 5 to 7 days after infection. This increased virulence was also reported by a study that showed a similar fatality rate in STAT2 knockout Syrian hamsters challenged with 10 PFU of the HB29 strain [52] . We have also observed a discrepancy in the body weights at death between our study and that of another group. In our data, A129 mice died after losing 15% of their body weight. But in a study using the SPL010 strain, mice died after losing 30% of their body weight [51] . These results might be due to a difference in virulence between the strains. Such differences in virulence between strains of the RVFV, a phlebovirus similar to SFTSV, have been reported [53] . The mechanisms of antibody inhibition of viral replication inside host cells have been studied extensively, especially in the case of influenza virus. The most-widely known mechanism is binding of an antibody to the portion of the virus that interacts with the host cell receptor, thereby blocking the interaction between the virus and the host cell [54] . Another group of antibodies was reported to bind the stem region of influenza hemagglutinin that is critical for conformational rearrangements that occur during membrane fusion [55] [56] [57] . This mechanism has more potential to be utilized for clinical development, because the stem region has fewer mutations than the receptor binding site. Additionally, several groups, including ours, have elucidated unconventional virus neutralizing mechanisms that affect the infection steps that occur after membrane fusion [58, 59] . In our crosslinking coupled mass spectrometry and alanine mutant studies, the Ab10 epitope was confined to domain II and the stem region of the Gn glycoprotein. Although the crystal structure of the phlebovirus Gn glycoprotein stem region has not yet been solved, a recent report showed a cryo-electron microscopy map of RVFV, and depicted the crystal structure of the RVFV Gn glycoprotein head region without a stem region [60] . The report also describes the membrane fusion mechanism of RVFV that is mediated by a low pH induced exposure of the hydrophobic Gc fusion loop. At a neutral pH, the Gn domain II (β-ribbon domain) shields the Gc fusion loop in the pre-fusion state and prevents premature fusion. Based on this report, we hypothesize that Ab10 simultaneously binds to domain II and the stem region of the Gn glycoprotein and prevents un-shielding of the Gc fusion loop. In conclusion, Ab10 is a monoclonal antibody that has shown therapeutic efficacy in a mouse SFTSV infection model. Although the neutralization efficacy of Ab10 was only tested in the Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain that was cultured in Vero cells, we confirmed its binding capability to recombinant SFTSV Gn in the HB29 and SD4 strains, which are both from China. According to the epitope revealed in this study, Ab10 is estimated to interact with the majority of SFTSV isolates currently reported. Based on these results, we believe that Ab10 has sufficient potential to be developed as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for a broad variety of SFTS isolates. The studies involving recovered patient's blood samples were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB approval number: 1405-031-576). All of the patients were adults and submitted written informed consent. All animal studies were conducted in an Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL-3) facility at the Institut Pasteur Korea according to the principles established by the Animal Protection Act and the Laboratory Animal Act in Republic of Korea. Interferon α/β receptor knockout (IFNAR1 -/-, A129) mice (B&K Universal, Hull, UK) were bred, raised, and genotyped at the Institut Pasteur Korea. All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Institut Pasteur Korea (Animal protocol number: IPK-17003-1). The SFTSV Gn glycoprotein amino acid sequences of various isolates used in this study were retrieved from the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR). To obtain SFTSV Gn glycoprotein ectodomain coding DNA strands, human codon optimized DNA sequences corresponding to amino acid sequences from 20 to 452 of GenBank Accession No. ADZ04471 (Strain HB29), ADZ04477 (Strain SD4), ADZ04486 (Strain AH 15), BAN58185 (Strain YG1), AGT98506 (Strain Gangwon/Korea/2012) were synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA and Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA). Human codon optimized DNA sequence of SFTSV Gc ectodomain of strain Gangwon/Korea/2012, corresponding to the sequence from 563 to 1035 of AGT98506, was also synthesized. For the overexpression and purification of recombinant SFTSV Gn/Gc glycoprotein ecotodomain fused to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma1 (IGHG1), termed Gn-Fc/Gc-Fc, or fused to the human immunoglobulin kappa constant region (IGKC), termed Gn-Cκ/Gn-Cκ, SFTSV Gn/Gc glycoprotein ectodomain encoding genes were cloned into the modified pCEP4 vector (V04450, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with a leader sequence of the human immunoglobulin kappa chain, two Sfil restriction enzyme sites, and the Fc region of human IGHG1 or human immunoglobulin kappa constant region, as previously described [61, 62] . Subsequently, the vectors were used to transfect HEK 293F (R79007, Invitrogen) or Expi293F cells (A14527, Invitrogen) using polyethylenimine (23966-1; Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA), then the transfected cells were cultured in FreeStyle 293 expression medium (12338026; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Overexpressed recombinant SFTSV Gn and Gc glycoprotein fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using MabSelect or KappaSelect columns with the Ä KTA Pure chromatography system (11003495, 17545811, 29018225; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. For alanine-scanning mutagenesis, SFTSV Gn glycoprotein with amino acid residues (315-389) substituted with alanine were produced by cloning synthesized DNA fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies) into a modified pCEP4 vector, as described above. Subsequently, influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag sequence (YPYDVPDYA) was introduced to the C-terminus of the Fc region of human immunoglobulin heavy gamma1 and the whole protein, designated as Gn-Fc-HA, was produced as described above. In order to produce histidine tagged SFTSV Gn glycoprotein, a ligand for surface plasmon resonance analysis, a Gn-Cκ with six carboxy-terminal poly-histidine residues was designed and produced as described above. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a patient who recovered from SFTS were collected using a Ficoll-Paque density gradient medium (17144002; GE Healthcare). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (15596018; Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using a Super-Script III first-strand cDNA synthesis kit with oligo dT priming (18080051; Invitrogen). From this cDNA, a phage-display library of human single-chain variable fragments (scFv) was constructed, and four rounds of biopanning were performed to select scFv antibody clones from the library, as previously described [63, 64] . For each round of biopanning, recombinant SFTSV Gn-Fc coated onto paramagnetic Dynabeads (14302D, Invitrogen) were used. To select SFTSV glycoprotein binding clones, phage ELISA was performed as previously described, using Gn or Gc glycoprotein-coated microtiter plates, scFv displaying phages, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-M13 antibody (11973-MM05, Sino Biological, Beijing, China) [64] . The nucleotide sequences of positive scFv clones were determined by Sanger nucleotide sequencing (Cosmogenetech, Seoul, South Korea). Germline sequences of selected antibody variable regions were analyzed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) IgBLAST. The genes encoding the variable heavy chain and variable light chain of Ab10 and MAb4-5 [31] were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, GenScript) and fused with the human heavy chain constant region gene (IgG 1 ) and human kappa light chain gene, and then cloned into an eukaryotic expression vector, as described previously [65, 66] . The expression vectors were transfected into HEK 293F cells. The IgG 1 molecule was purified from the culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using MabSelect as described above. Genes encoding the scFv-Fc fusion protein and the scFv-Cκ fusion protein were synthesized and cloned into a pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen). After transfection into HEK 293F cells, the recombinant proteins were overexpressed and purified as described above. The SFTSV strain of Gangwon/Korea/2012 [3] was propagated in Vero cells (10081, Korean Cell Link Bank) with Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium (LM 011-01; Welgene, Daegu, South Korea) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (16000044; Gibco) and penicillin-streptomycin (10378016; Gibco). The fifty-percent tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) values were titrated on Vero cells using the Reed-Muench method [67] . Ab10 or MAB4-5 scFv-Fc fusion protein was serially diluted in 10-fold increments from a 50 μg/mL concentration, then mixed with an equal volume of 100 TCID 50 SFTSV and incubated at 37˚C for 1 h. The virus-antibody mixture was transferred onto Vero cells in 8-well chamber slides (154534; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and incubated at 37˚C for 1 h. For the no-infection-control group, no virus was added to the cells. In contrast, for the infection-control group, no antibody was incubated with the virus. After removing the virus-antibody mixture, cells were cultured for 2 days. For the IFA, cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with 5 μg/mL of anti-SFTSV Gn glycoprotein antibody [68] at 4˚C overnight. After washing, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:100 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Fc antibody (111-095-046; Jackson Immu-noResearch, West Grove, PA, USA). To stain the nucleus, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) was used. Fluorescence image of cells was monitored under a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP8; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). For animal experiments, the titer of SFTSV was measured by plaque forming assays [69] . Tenfold serial dilutions of SFTSV were inoculated onto monolayers of Vero cells in 6-well tissue culture plates for 1 h at room temperature. After removal of the virus, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (12100-046; Gibco) based overlay medium containing 0.7% agar (214010; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 7 days. For visualization of plaques, the overlay medium was removed and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by staining with 0.05% (w/v) crystal violet solution (C0775; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO USA). Either 2 or 20 plaque forming units (PFU) of Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain SFTSV in 200 μL of PBS were inoculated in 8-to 10-week-old male or female A129 mice by a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection route. After 1 h of infection, mice were administered with Ab10 IgG 1 antibody or a PBS vehicle control through an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection route, at 30 mg/kg of body weight for every 24 h for a consecutive 4 days. Palivizumab (MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) or Mab4-5 IgG 1 was used as an isotype control or a positive control antibody, respectively. In the delayed treatment model, the infected mice were treated with antibodies at 1, 3, 4, or 5 days post-infection (d.p.i.) for 4 days consecutively. Body weight and survival of mice were monitored until 10 days post-infection. In order to measure the binding activities of the Ab10 and MAb4-5 IgG 1 antibodies, 96-well half-area microplates (3690; Corning, Corning, NY, USA) were coated with Gn-Fc fusion protein and incubated at 4˚C overnight. Plates were blocked with 3% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed with PBS and received antibodies that were 10-fold serially diluted from 1 μM to 10 μM in blocking buffer. The plates were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature and washed three times with 0.05% Tween20 in PBS solution. Then, 50 μL of HRP-conjugated anti-human Ig kappa light chain antibody (AP502P; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) diluted in blocking buffer (1:5000) was added into each well. Then, plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, each well received 50 μL of 3,3 0 ,5,5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution (34028; Thermo Scientific). The color reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 2 M sulfuric acid. The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Multiskan GO; Thermo Scientific). The kinetics of Ab10 and Gn glycoprotein binding were measured by surface plasmon resonance analysis, using a Biacore T200 instrument with sensor chip CM5, amine coupling kit, and his capture kit (28975001, 29149603, BR100050, 28995056; GE Healthcare). We followed the recommended manufacturer's protocol for the procedures and conditions of reaction buffers, flow times, flow rates, and concentration of analytes. Briefly, anti-histidine antibody was immobilized on an activated CM5 chip, followed by a deactivation step. Then, histidine tagged Gn-Cκ was injected over the flow cells prior to antibody injection. For the association step, all of the Ab10 IgG 1 antibody in PBS at concentrations of two-fold increments ranging from 1.25 nM to 80 nM was injected for 3 min. For the dissociation step, PBS containing 0.005% of Tween20 was injected for 5 min. After each dissociation step, chip regeneration was performed. The epitope of Ab10 antibody was first determined by analyzing the complex of Ab10 antibody and SFTSV Gn-Cκ antigen linked with deuterated cross-linkers (CovalX, Zürich, Switzerland), as previously described [32] . Briefly, antibody, antigen, and antibody/antigen complexes were characterized by high mass matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry using a MALDI TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometer (Autoflex III; Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) equipped with an interaction module (HM4; CovalX, Zürich, Switzerland). Afterwards, the antibody/antigen complex was crosslinked with DSS d0/d12 isotope-labeled homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, followed by reduction alkylation using dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, and urea. To digest the reduced complex, a proteolytic buffer composed of trypsin, chymotrypsin, endoproteinase Asp-N, elastase, and thermolysin was used. The sample was then analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography (Ultimate 3000; Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and Orbitrap mass spectrometry (Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap; Thermo Scientific). To measure the binding activities of Ab10 to mutated Gn, Ab10 scFv-Cκ antibody and an anti-influenza virus hemagglutinin antibody (clone 12CA5; Bio X Cell, Lebanon, NH, USA) were coated on a microplate, in parallel. Then, plates were blocked with 3% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Transiently transfected cell supernatant containing recombinant Gn-Fc-HA proteins with alanine substitution was added to each well. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the microplate was washed three times with 0.05% Tween20 in PBS solution. Then, HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc antibody (31423; Invitrogen) diluted in blocking buffer was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, each well received 50 μL of 3,3 0 ,5,5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution (34028; Thermo Scientific). The color reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 2 M sulfuric acid. The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Multiskan GO; Thermo Scientific). Relative reactivity was calculated using absorbance values (Abs) as follows: % relative reactivity = [100 × {(Abs of mutant captured by Ab10) / (Abs of mutant captured by HA antibody)} / {(Abs of wildtype captured by Ab10) / (Abs of wildtype captured by HA antibody)}]. ELISA and IFA data including statistical comparisons were analyzed and graphed using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA, USA). Fluorescent signals measured by confocal microscopy were quantified using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence software. Mass spectrometry data were analyzed using XQuest and Stavrox software. Plasmon surface resonance data were analyzed using BIAevaluation software. Visualization, alignment, and phylogenic analyses of amino acid sequences were performed with Geneious software. Thirty to fifty focus forming units (FFU) of SFTSV were incubated with serially diluted scFv-Fc fusion proteins for 1 h at room temperature and transferred to Vero cells in a 24-well tissue culture plate. After incubation for 1 h at 37˚C in a 5% CO 2 incubator, the cells were overlaid with 0.5% methylcellulose in RPMI medium with 2% fetal bovine serum and cultured for 2 days. Cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 15 min and incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Then, SFTSV localized clusters (foci) were visualized by incubating with 1 μg/mL of anti-SFTSV Gc glycoprotein antibody (Clone Ab3 from patent PCT/KR2017/003156) for 1 h, followed by incubation with 1:2,000 diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG Fc fragment specific antibody, conjugated with HRP (111-035-008; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) for 30 min and DAB substrate (K5007-BC; Dako). The percentage of neutralization was calculated for each diluted solution of antibody as the percentage of decreased fraction in the number of foci compared to that of the virus without incubation of scFv-Fc fusion protein. An irrelevant scFv-Fc fusion protein was used as an isotype control. Dose-response curves were drawn by non-linear regression analyses (variable slope model) and 50% FRNT values were determined from graphs using GraphPad Prism6 software. To examine binding activity of Ab10 antibody to SFTSV generated from Vero cells, serially diluted viral supernatants of SFTSV infected cells with a determined titer or the supernatant of mock-infected cells was coated onto microtiter plates (2692; Costar) at 4˚C overnight. Fifty to five thousand PFU of SFTSV were used to coat each well. The plates were then incubated with serial dilutions of Ab10 antibody or Palivizumab as an isotype control, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc antibody (31423; Invitrogen). Reactions were developed by adding TMB substrate (34028; Thermo Scientific) and were terminated by adding 2 M sulfuric acid. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The amount of virus coated on each microplate well is indicated on the top of each graph, and the mean absorbance with standard deviation (s.d.) error bars is shown for each antibody concentration. Absorbance of Ab10 antibody bound to SFTSV-coated wells (red), Palivizumab bound to SFTSV-coated wells (blue), Ab10 antibody bound to mock-virus coated wells (magenta), and Palivizumab bound to mock-virus coated wells (purple) are shown in the graph. (TIF) The amino acid sequence of Gn glycoprotein from 272 SFTSV isolates deposited in ViPR were used for analysis. The sequences were trimmed to retain the amino acid residues from 20-452 that corresponded to the ectodomain. Trimmed sequences were analyzed, and a phylogenetic tree was built in a circular tree layout using the neighbor-joining method with a Jukes-Cantor genetic distance model. The names of isolates are labeled beside the tip of each branch. Asterisks at the tip of branches indicate the isolates that were tested for binding activity of Ab10. (TIF) Recombinant SFTSV Gn-Cκ was prepared with sample buffer and reducing agent (NP0008 and NP0004; Invitrogen). The samples were then separated on a polyacrylamide gel (NP0321BOX; Invitrogen) by electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% (w/v) skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) the membrane was incubated with 100 ng/mL of five (Ab6 to Ab10) SFTSV Gn specific antibodies in a scFv-Fc format. Gn bound antibodies were probed with HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc antibody (31423; Invitrogen). To confirm the presence of Gn-Cκ protein, HRP-conjugated anti-human Ig kappa light chain antibody (AP502P, Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) was used to directly detect Gn-Cκ. The blots were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (34578; Thermo Scientific). (TIF) S8 Fig. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences covering the Ab10 epitope. The amino acid sequence of Gn glycoprotein from the 272 SFTSV isolates deposited in ViPR were analyzed. The sequences were trimmed to retain the amino acids from 313-389 that correspond to the residues recognized by Ab10. Trimmed sequences were analyzed, and a phylogenetic tree was built in a circular tree layout using the neighbor-joining method with a Jukes-Cantor genetic distance model. The names of isolates are written beside the tip of each branch. Strain names labeled in red indicate that the Gn glycoprotein of the indicated strain is predicted to not interact with Ab10. (TIF)

       "A new personal aerosol sampler has recently been developed and verified to be very efficient for monitoring of viable bioaerosol bacteria, fungi and viruses (Agranovski et al., 2002 (Agranovski et al., , 2005a . The operational principle is based on passing of air sample through porous medium submerged into a layer of collecting liquid. As the result, during passing through narrow and tortuous channels inside the porous medium, the air stream is split into a multitude of very small bubbles with the particulates are being scavenged by these bubbles and, thus, effectively removed before the effluent air leaves the device. Bioaerosol particles are being accumulated in the collecting liquid during the entire process of sampler operation. verification of the sampler for monitoring of common viruses with different levels of sensitivity to physical and biological stresses showed that it can recover up to 25% of rather labile Influenza virus, whilst a very robust and stable Vaccinia virus is being recovered at the level of 90% (Agranovski et al., 2005a,b) . A higher survival level of biological material was observed when the sampler was tested on bacteria (Agranovski et al., 2002) . Considering that the sampler utilizes bubbling process for bioaerosol collection, one of the most important parameters responsible for microbial recovery is an inactivation of collected microorganisms during such processes. The corresponding study, which involved five viral strains (Influenza, Mumps, Measles, Vaccinia and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)) with various sensitivities to stress, has been undertaken (Agranovski et al., 2004a,b) . Based on the results of investigation, an exponential kinetics of microbial inactivation in collecting fluid was preset. This paper derives a mathematical model for the determination of the concentration of airborne bioaerosols in analyzed air sample based on the number of live particles detected in the collecting liquid after sampling. The minimal concentration of live airborne microorganisms measurable by the device was also evaluated. In the second part of the paper we describe a model of aerosol propagation, derived for outdoor conditions, based on a semiempiric equation of turbulent diffusion (Monin and Yaglom, 1965) . Simultaneous application of two models allows one to determine the optimal sampling locations for the best possible coverage of the area to be monitored. The possibility of obtaining reliable values of virus-containing aerosol concentrations under real conditions of the sampler operation was demonstrated taking as an example the simulated hypothetic ''terrorist act'' involving viral material under city conditions. Let us determine the number of viable viruses n accumulated in the collecting fluid within the sampling time, T. During the sampler operating time from t to t+Dt (0ptpT), the number of bioaerosol particles collected by the device is: where k is the coefficient taking into account the efficiency of aspiration and capture of virus-containing particles by collecting fluid (0pkp1), Q is the sampling flow rate, and C(t) is the calculated concentration of viruscontaining particles in the air. As discussed earlier, some microbial inactivation could occur during sampling process due to bubbling related stress. As the result, along with time related increase of the number of collected viral particles, the competitive process of their inactivation will take place in collecting fluid. Linear approximation of the live virus concentration values, C s (t), in the collecting fluid for different bubbling time periods t results in the exponential dependence of biological activity of viruses on the time: n(t) ¼ n(0) exp(Àt/t), where t is the time of the virus activity decrease by a factor of e % 2:72. The correlation coefficient of experimentally obtained points relative to the straight line log 10 C s ¼ a+bt for viruses studied in the works of Agranovski et al. (2004a,b) varies from À0.88 to À0.99, and the time t varies from 0.53 to 1.45 h. Due to microbial inactivation, the number of viral particles, Dn ¼ kQC(t) exp[À(TÀt)/t]Dt, collected by the sampler during time period from t to t+Dt will remain viable on completion of the sampling procedure. As the result, the total number of viable viral particles in the sample at the time instant T will be where N ¼ T/Dt is an integer number. Eq. (1) corresponds to the formula for determining the measured countable concentration of virus-containing aerosols, C 0 mes ¼ n=ðQTÞ, expressed through the measured concentration C(t), In general, the medium where atmospheric pollutant spread occurs is turbulent and, as the result, C and, consequently, C 0 mes are random values. Applying the averaging procedure by the statistical assembly to Eq. (2) yields where broken brackets indicate the averaging procedure by the statistical assembly. Assuming that the sampling time was much shorter compared to meteorological conditions changing time, the sampling could be considered as stationary. Consequently, spread of virus-containing aerosols in atmosphere can be taken as hCðtÞi ¼ C 0 ¼ const and Some comparative analysis of Eqs. (2) and (3) shows that, in general case, the mathematical expectation of Eq. (2) is unbiased, as hC 0 mes i and C 0 values do not coincide. The unbiased C mes estimate can be obtained by introducing an additional coefficient into Eq. (2): In fact, application of the averaging procedure by the statistical assembly to Eq. (4) gives hC mes ¼ C 0 i. For random stationary processes, the averaging procedure by the statistical assembly is equivalent to the averaging procedure by time (see, for example, Tikhonov, 1982) . As a matter of fact, expression (4) presents a linear estimate of the average integral value of suspended realization in the interval (0,T): where hðtÞ ¼ ð1=tÞ exp½ÀðT À tÞ=t=½1 À expðÀT=tÞ is the determinated weighting function normalized to unity in the interval (0,T). Thus, in case of acceptance of the exponential kinetics of microbial inactivation in collecting fluid, then in order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the countable concentration of virus-containing aerosols, C mes , the value C 0 mes ¼ n=ðQTÞ ought to be multiplied by the factor m(T/t): Fig. 1 shows the dependence of the fudge factor m the normalized sampling time T=t. As is seen from the graph, the increase of the sampling time, T, is associated with the corresponding increase of the m value. According to Tikhonov (1982) , Eq. (5) for dispersion of the concentration, s 2 mes , for the stationary case can be expressed as where B(x) is the correlation function of pulsation of virus-containing aerosols concentration. Borodulin and his colleagues (1999) suggested the following form of the stationary correlation function of pulsations of atmospheric pollutants concentration using the apparatus of the Marcovian processes theory: where s 2 is the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants concentration and t (E) is the Euler time scale of turbulent pulsations of wind velocity. The substitution of (8) into (7) yields the following expression: The integration procedure results in the following: In the notation s 2 mes ðTÞ the argument in the brackets accentuates that sampling is performed within the interval with duration T. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of s 2 mes =s 2 on T=t for the values t/t (E) ¼ 100, 50, 10, 2. As follows from the presented curves, the value s 2 mes =s 2 increases with decreasing t=t ðEÞ and tends to zero at T=t ! þ1. It can be seen that the measurements should be performed within a sufficiently long time to provide the dispersion of measurements lower than a certain threshold value. For example, if at t=t ðEÞ ¼ 50 we preset s 2 mes =s 2 o0:05, then T=t40:9. The values of the time scale t ðEÞ in the near-ground atmospheric layer have the order of magnitude of tens or hundreds of seconds (see, for example, Borodulin et al., 1992) explaining why curves 1 and 2 in Fig. 2 better correspond to real sampling conditions for the case under consideration. With some limitations, the derived formulas could also be used in a case when the sampler is employed for monitoring bioaerosols with concentrations that are nonstationary in time. When sampling times, T, are much larger than the Euler time scale, t ðEÞ , the ergodicity condition would be approximately fulfilled (Tikhonov, 1982) with Eq. (5) remaining unchanged. The expression for dispersion of the unbiased estimate for the nonstationary case can be obtained from Eq. (7) by presetting ''quasi-stationary'' form of the correlation function of the concentration pulsations as (Byzova, 1974) : Quasi-stationarity becomes apparent in the fact that, along with C(t) value changing on the average rather slowly in the interval (0,T), quick pulsations with frequencies of the order of 1=t ðEÞ impose on the process of the concentration change. In this case, The work mode of the personal sampler implies its movement in the space along some route in the process of sampling. Let us divide the sampling time T into K intervals no overlapping with each other. Let the time vary from T k to T k +DT k for a k being some time interval (k ¼ 1; K). If aerosol concentration values in the intervals T k are statistically mutually independent, then, T ¼ P k DT k is the unbiased estimate of the concentration which can be performed by Eq. (6). This estimate will reflect the average integral value of the concentration along the route. The dispersion of such unbiased estimate, s 2 mes K , is determined as a sum of dispersions for each time interval T k as Now, let us evaluate the minimal countable concentration of live airborne particles, which can be recorded by the personal sampler. The minimal measurable number of microorganisms in the collecting liquid depends on their nature and microbiological procedure employed. For bacteria and fungi (Agranovski et al., 2002) , this number can be as small as 1 CFU (colony forming unit) per entire amount of collecting liquid (50 mL). To achieve this level of resolution, the whole amount of liquid is being filtered through the membrane with following placement of the membrane onto the surface of bacterial/fungal agar. After 1-5 days on incubation, the grown colonies are counted and corresponding concentration in the air is obtained (Agranovski et al., 2002) . However, in a case of determination of live airborne viruses, the sensitivity of analytical methods is substantially lower. For viral assays, 100 mL of collecting liquid is added into each well containing monolayer of corresponding cells. For practical situations, six wells are used for each measurement making the total amount of analyzed liquid-600 mL. Considering, that 1 PFU (plaque forming unit) can be detected, the minimal countable concentration of virus is 1 PFU per 600 mL of liquid, which corresponds to $2 PFU mL À1 . Considering that the sensitivity of viral assay is lower compared to bacteria/fungi detection, 2 units mL À1 (worst case scenario) is taken for further consideration. This value, for the sampling flowrate of 4 L min À1 and particle collection efficiency assumed to be 100% (such assumption is supported by our previous tests of the sampler collection efficiency, Agranovski et al., 2002) , corresponds to the airborne microbial concentration of approximately 2.5 Â 10 4 /T(min) units m À3 . The values of the countable concentration of viruses in the sample equal to or smaller than this value cannot be considered as reliable. On this basis and following Eq. (6), the expression for estimation of the minimal value of the countable concentration of live bioaerosols C min , which could be detected by the sampler is C min ðunits m À3 Þ % 2:5 Â 10 4 TðminÞ T=t k½1 À expðÀT=tÞ . The dependence of C min on T=t with the accuracy to within the factor 2.5 Â 10 4 /T(min) (units m À3 ) corresponds to the trend of the curve presented in Fig. 1 . To determine the countable concentration of bioaerosols, the semi-empiric equation of turbulent diffusion was used as (Monin and Yaglom, 1965) : where V s is the rate of gravitation settling of particles; hU x i, hU y i, hU z i are mathematical expectations of components of wind velocity; K x , K y , K z are components of the tensor of turbulent diffusion coefficients; hQi is a parameter describing sources of virus-containing aerosols, and b is the constant of inactivation of airborne viral particles. The coordinate axis z is directed vertically upwards, and axes x and y in the horizontal plane eastwards and northwards, respectively. It should be noted that the derivation of the semi-empiric equation also implies the fulfillment of the condition that the time of atmospheric pollutant spread T should be much larger than the Euler time scale t ðEÞ . Thus, the formulas for determining unbiased estimates of the concentration of bioaerosols and the used method of simulation of the concentration fields are mutually intercoordinated. To solve Eq. (11), it is necessary to set values of hU x i, hU y i, hU z i and K x , K y , K z . The numericanalytical model (Desyatkov et al., 1996) was used to preset the values hU x i, hU y i, hU z i. In this model the presence of buildings, trees and other elements of usual outdoor environment is taken into account by presetting the corresponding roughness parameters of the underlying surface. The components of the tensor of turbulent diffusion coefficients K x , K y , K z were preset in accordance with the hypothesis of their proportionality to the corresponding components of the tensor of Reynolds viscous stresses experimentally justified under natural conditions (Borodulin, 1996) . These components, in their turn, were determined using the algebraic model for turbulent flows and stresses similar to Teverovskii and Dmitriev (1988) . Eq. (11) was solved with finite-difference methods using splitting procedures by physical processes and spatial variables (see, for example, Marchuk, 1982; Penenko and Aloyan, 1985) . A hypothetical episode concerned with music concert in the central square of Novosibirsk is considered in the calculations, see Fig. 3 . The concert was hold from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. local time under meteorological conditions typical for the middle of July. The territory on which there was a crowd is shown in Fig. 3 with a dotted square. South-western wind was preset in the calculations with the velocity of 2 m s À1 at the height z ¼ 5 m above the underlying surface at the western boundary of the area under study, point ''A'' in Fig. 3 . According to the legend, during the concert the ''terrorists'' performed concealed use of a preparation of a highly pathogenic viral strain in aerosol form. A car with the aerosol source was running along the central street of the city crossing the square at the speed of 18 km h À1 . The source is shown by a solid line with an arrow in Fig. 3 . The spraying line was 250 m long. A total of 250 g of the preparation with the concentration of viral particles of 5 Â 10 10 g À1 was discharged into the atmosphere along the spraying line at the height of 2 m above the underlying surface. The spraying started at 3 p.m. It lasted for 40 s, which was much shorter than the concert duration. On this basis, the parameter hQi was preset as an ''instant'' linear source that occurred at 3 p.m. local time. Considering that the virus used by ''terrorists'' was very robust, the value b could be taken as zero. Aerodynamic diameter of particles was preset equal to 5 mm. Obviously, for the conditions set up for this case, V s value could be neglected. The calculations were performed on the difference template of 51 Â 35 Â 50 nodes with a step of 20 m along the horizontal line and 1.5 m along the vertical line, respectively. Fig. 4 presents the dependence of the number concentration of virus-containing aerosols hCi on the spreading time calculated at the height z ¼ 1.5 m above the underlying surface for points marked in Fig. 3 as 1 and 2 . It can be seen that the aerosol cloud crosses the area of the square heavily populated by people (shown with a dotted line) within less than 5 min. The parameters of sampling were preset as follows; k ¼ 1, t ¼ 3600 s (the value accepted from the range identified before), and the sampling height z ¼ 1.5 m. The sampler situated at a certain fixed point of a region shown in Fig. 3 was switched on for a time T ¼ 10 min when the spraying began. Under the preset conditions the fudge factor in (6) m ¼ 1:09. Fig. 5 presents the scheme of the calculation area in the form in which it was approximated on the calculation template. Light-gray color shows buildings, and dark-gray color shows vegetation covertrees, lawns and bushes. Fig. 5 also presents isolines of mathematical expectation of the concentration of virus-containing aerosols obtained by applying the averaging procedures by statistical assembly to Eq. (5): The levels of isolines 1-5 shown in Fig. 5 correspond to the values of the measured countable bioaerosol concentration hC mes i ¼ 2:5 Â 10 7 , 5 Â 10 6 , 5 Â 10 5 , 5 Â 10 4 , 5 Â 10 3 units m À3 , respectively. In our case, considering that the device operated for 60 min time period, the minimal reliably measurable concentration of bioaerosol is 4.2 Â 10 2 units m À3 . Consequently, in the case under consideration all data obtained by samplers within the area shown with a dotted line can be considered as reliable. Eq. (9) can be used to estimate the value of s 2 mes . Firstly, determine the time scale t ðEÞ by the empiric formula t (E) E(4578)z/U where z should be preset in m, and U is the module of wind velocity at the height z in m/s (Borodulin et al., 1992) . In the considered example t (E) E70 s. That is why curve 3 corresponds to the dependence s 2 mes =s 2 on the normalized sampling time T=t in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that at the preset sampling conditions the errors in the estimate of C mes make up s 2 mes =s 2 % 0:7, which is a rather large value. Thus, for utilization of the personal sampler, to obtain unbiased estimates of the countable concentration of virus-containing aerosols, besides taking into account the efficiency of capture of particles sampler, a fudge factor m should be introduced. The physical nature of this factor is associated with exponential kinetics of viral particle degradation in a suspension at air bubbling through a porous membrane. The fudge factor depends on the sampling time T and the typical time of viral activity decrease t. The fudge factor value increases (12) for the height z ¼ 1.5 m. Numbers 1-5, respectively, correspond to the values, hC mes i ¼ 2:5 Â 10 7 , 5 Â 10 6 , 5 Â 10 5 , 5 Â 10 4 , 5 Â 10 3 units m À3 . with T=t increase. As the result, the average integral value of the countable concentration within the sampling time from t to t+T can be obtained. The dispersion of the unbiased estimate of the concentration of virus-containing aerosols C mes is determined by Eq. (9). The dispersion of the unbiased estimate of the concentration s 2 mes decreases with T increase and increases with a decrease in t=t ðEÞ parameter. The values of the countable concentration of virus-containing aerosols lower than the threshold values determined by Eq. (10) cannot be considered as reliable. Considering a very high physical collection efficiency of the sampler (Agranovski et al., 2002) , in our calculations we assumed this value to be unity, however, the particular number corresponding to the size of targeted microorganism can be obtained from our previous paper (Agranovski et al., 2002) and directly used to correct the final results (the minimal measurable concentration in the air should be divided by the collection efficiency). The carried out model calculations show that the use of the present personal sampler under conditions of open atmosphere can provide the detection of bioaerosols and allows making reliable estimates of their countable concentration averaged on the sampling interval for a range of concentrations exceeding the threshold limit.

       "The highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affected individuals in 30 countries in 2002 and 2003 [1] . Its causative agent was identified as a novel SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1, 2, 3] that was initially classified as part of a separate coronavirus group [4, 5, 6, 7] , but is now described as a betacoronavirus [8] . As with most coronaviruses, SARS-CoV encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) [4, 9] . Mature coronavirus particle assembly involves protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. M, the most abundant structural protein [10] , is thought to play a central role in directing virus assembly and budding via interaction with E, S and N [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] . Translated on free polysomes, N is associated with newly synthesized viral genomic RNA to form helical nucleocapsids [19] . The M membrane glycoprotein is cotranslationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to Golgi complexes [20, 21] . M interacts with nucleocapsids on the cell membranes of ER or Golgi complexes [22, 23, 24, 25, 26] . In a similar manner, S and E proteins are translated on membrane-bound polysomes, inserted into the ER, and transported to Golgi complexes, where E and M interact and trigger virion budding with enclosed nucleocapsids [14, 19] . S is incorporated into virions via interactions with M. Virions accumulate in large, smooth-walled vesicles that are exocytotically released from cells [4] . Despite lacking a significant amino acid sequence homology, SARS-CoV M shares structural and functional similarities with other coronavirus M proteins [27] . In addition to having an amino-terminal ectodomain, a triple-membrane spanning domain, and a carboxyl-terminal endodomain [19, 28] , coronavirus M proteins localize exclusively in the ER/Golgi area [29, 30, 31] . However, the M proteins of SARS-CoV, the transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and the feline infectious peritonitis virus are all capable of reaching the plasma membrane [32, 33, 34, 35] . M plus E [36, 37, 38] or M plus N [16, 39] are minimum requirements for SARS-CoV VLP formation, and the combined expression of M, N and E is necessary for efficient VLP production [40] . SARS-CoV M has been detected in medium when expressed alone [37] . We previously demonstrated that SARS-CoV M is capable of self-association and secretion into medium as membrane-enveloped vesicles with a buoyant density slightly less than that of VLPs formed by M plus N [41] . Since N is undetectable in medium without M coexpression, it appears that SARS-CoV M directs VLP assembly by incorporating N into VLPs. Accordingly, mutations that block SARS-CoV M self-assembly or secretion also block VLP assembly, regardless of their effect (or lack of) on M-N interaction. Our goal in this study was to identify specific SARS-CoV M amino acid residues that are critical for VLP assembly. Sitedirected mutagenesis results suggest the involvement of M cytoplasmic tail dileucine residues in the packaging of N into VLPs. We observed that amino acid residues that are important for M self-assembly or secretion are dispersed along the carboxyl-terminal endodomain and the amino-terminal region, including the transmembrane domains. This finding supports the proposal that multiple SARS-CoV M regions are involved in M self-assembly. Here we will report on our identification of several amino acid residues that may play a role in SARS-CoV assembly. SARS-CoV M contains three cysteine residues: C63 and C85 are found at the second and third transmembrane domains, respectively, and C158 is located at the carboxyl-terminal endodomain (Fig. 1) . Results from our tests to determine whether cysteine residues play a role in SARS-CoV VLP assembly indicate that a serine substitution at C63 or C85, or a combined C63/85S double-mutation, did not significantly affect VLP assembly and release ( Fig. 2A , lanes 11, 12 and 14) . In contrast, single or combined double or triple substitutions of cysteine residues involving C158 markedly affected VLP production, likely a result of reduced M secretion. Note that secreted M mutants carrying the C158S mutation are glycosylated form-deficient ( Fig. 2A upper panel, lanes 13, 15 and 16), suggesting an M-C158S maturation defect via the classical secretory pathway (54) . As a control, N expressed by itself was not released into medium (Fig. 2B, lane 8 ). An HA tagged at the M amino-terminus (HA-M) had no major effect on M release and N packaging; in contrast, a FLAG tagged at the M carboxyl terminus (M-FLAG) significantly affected N incorporation (Fig. 2B, lane 11 ). This is consistent with previously reported results [41] . We found that N coexpression slightly increased wt or secretion-competent M mutant release, but had little effect on the release of secretion-defective mutants. This observation does not alter our conclusion that N release or VLP production depends on the presence of secretion-competent M proteins. Since M+N VLP assembly is determined by M release capacity, we determined the mutational effects on M release capacity under N coexpression conditions. The results shown in Figure 2A suggest that C158 is necessary for SARS-CoV M selfassembly or release. To determine whether any of the three cysteine residues exist at the M dimer interface, we treated VLPs with bismaleimidohexane (BMH), a cysteine-specific cross-linking reagent. The HIV-1 precursor Pr55gag, which is capable of self-assembly into VLPs, served as a positive control. As shown in Figure 2C , we noted a band of approximately 110 kDa corresponding to the Pr55gag dimer (lane 4, arrowhead), which is consistent with an earlier report that cysteine residues in the Pr55gag interaction (I) domain are capable of cross-linking via BMH [42] . In contrast, we failed to detect dimeric or multimeric forms of M in repeat independent experiments (Fig. 2D, lanes 5 and 7) . Combined, the data suggest that the C63, C85 and C158 residues found in the M dimer in a VLP context are not close enough to be cross-linked by BMH. While constructing the C85S mutation, we unintentionally created a triple mutant (C85S/F95L/S110G) that was severely defective in VLP assembly. Results from further analysis indicate that either the F95L or S110G mutation significantly affected M secretion and VLP production (data not shown). Since the S110 mutation is located in the highly conserved 107-SWWSFNPE-114 motif, it is not surprising that S110G impaired VLP assembly. When analyzing the impacts of a F95L mutation, we found that an alanine substitution for F95 significantly impaired VLP assembly, but a tryptophan substitution did not (details given below). This indication of an important VLP assembly role for the conserved aromatic residue at codon 95 served as our motivation to investigate similar roles for the nearby residues W91 and Y94two conserved aromatic residues that co-reside with F95 in the third transmembrane domain. We also created alanine and leucine substitutions for W57, which is located in the second transmembrane domain (Fig. 1) . P58, which is conserved and located next to W57, was changed into alanine because both tryptophan and proline may play a role in protein-protein interaction [43, 44] . Based on one research team's proposal that the dileucine motif is involved in sorting and trafficking [45] , we replaced two dileucine motifs located in the carboxyl-terminal (L218-L219) region with alanine. Based on past results suggesting that the M self-association domain is largely located among 50 amino-terminal residues [41] , we changed an amino-terminal dileucine motif (L15-L16) and the W19 conserved aromatic residue into alanines to determine whether they are involved in VLP assembly. For an additional control we used the N-linked glycosylation blocking mutation N4Q, which is known for not exerting any major impacts on virus assembly or M trafficking [35, 46] . As expected, unglycosylated N4Q was capable of producing VLPs at near-wt levels (Fig. 3A , lanes 9 versus 10). The dileucine mutation 15LL/AA did not significantly affect M secretion or N packaging (Fig. 3A, lane 11 ). M-15LL/AA was almost found in glycosylated form (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 11) . A possible explanation is that the 15LL/AA mutation may facilitate the M glycosylation process. The glycosylated form of M was occasionally (and predominantly) detected in medium (Fig. 3B, lane 16) ; this is insufficient evidence to confirm that N-glycan modification makes a significant Underlined mutations denote that changing the aromatic residue to Ala or Leu markedly affected M secretion, but replacement with another aromatic residue did not. The ability for each construct to release or produce VLPs with coexpressed N is summarized in Table 1 . doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0064013.g001 Medium pellet samples corresponding to 50% of total and cell lysate samples corresponding to 5% of total were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters. SARS-CoV M was probed with rabbit antiserum, and N contribution to M secretion or VLP assembly, since M-N4Q devoid of N-glycosylation is also competent in self-secretion and N packaging. Substitution mutations at the M carboxyl tail (218LL/AA) resulted in a statistically insignificant decrease in M secretion, with coexpressed N barely detectable in medium (Fig. 3A, lane 13 ). This suggests that the 218LL/AA mutation may impair M-N association, which would agree with previous reports that the SARS-CoV M carboxyl-terminal region is involved in M-N interaction [16, 47] . Alanine or leucine changes in W19 ( 4A, lanes 13) . We have tried to find an adequate explanation for this observation. It may be that the released chimeric vesicles contain greater amounts of F95L than of HA-M or M-FLAG due to favorable F95L incorporation. We observed that in the presence of M-FLAG or HA-M, immature unglycosylated forms of W91A, Y94A and F95L were more abundant in medium than their glycosylated counterparts, while F95A had a greater abundance of the unglycosylated form in medium when coexpressed with HA-M (Fig. 4A , lanes 10-13, lower vs. upper arrowheads). This is likely evidence of preferential association between HA-M or M-FLAG and immature unglycosylated mutant forms. Combined, these results suggest that some secretion-defective mutants can be rescued into wt M particles via M-M interaction. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to further determine whether reduced M secretion was due to a selfassociation defect. First, we individually coexpressed secretiondefective mutants with their FLAG-tagged counterparts. As shown in Figure 4B , W19A, W91A, Y94A or F95L were coprecipitated with their FLAG-tagged versions. According to velocity sedimentation analyses of cell lysates containing expressed M proteins, W19A, W91A, Y94A and F95A/L were capable of multimerizing into high-molecular-weight complexes in a pattern that was difficult to distinguish from that of the wt M (data not shown). These results suggest that secretion-defective mutants are capable of a certain level of self-association despite defective VLP assembly or release. Results from immunofluorescence studies indicate that wt or secretion-competent mutants are localized in both perinuclear and plasma membrane areas. Although most of the secretion-defective mutants did not show plasma membrane localization, the secretion-defective W19A was found in both plasma membrane and perinuclear areas-a staining pattern indistinguishable from that of the wt (data not shown). This suggests that the M release defect is not completely attributable to a defect in plasma membrane localization. We predicted that in cases where mutants express delayed assembly or budding, medium VLP quantities would increase as incubation time increased. Our data indicate that most of the secretion-defective mutants were readily detectable in culture supernatant 48 h post-transfection (Fig. 5A , lanes 17-20 and Fig. 5B, lanes 12-14) . This finding suggests that reductions in M secretion or VLP production are partly due to delays in assembly or budding. However, after 48 h of incubation, N remained barely detectable in medium, or detectable but not equivalent to the level of released M, suggesting a mutant defect in terms of N packaging. This finding also suggests that the M mutations may have affected N viral incorporation in addition to impairing M secretion. Next, we investigated whether secretion-defective M mutants can still interact with N, and whether the failure of secretioncompetent 218LL/AA to form VLPs is due to a defect in N association. N, wt or mutant M was coexpressed with GST-N (a GST fused to the N amino-terminus) and subjected to GST-pull down assays. Since N contains a dimerization domain, N association with GST-N was used as a control [48, 49] . As expected, N was efficiently pulled down by GST-N. With the exception of C158S, all of the tested secretion-defective M mutants were co-pulled down with GST-N (Fig. 6) , suggesting that M mutants are still capable of N association despite being defective in terms of cell release. Unexpectedly, 218LL/AA and M-FLAG were efficiently pulled down by GST-N (Fig. 6C, lanes 11 and 12) . Similar results were obtained from co-immunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-N antibody (Fig. 6D) . Levels of Nassociated M-C158S, as determined by GST pull-down or coimmunoprecipitation assays, were lower compared to those of the other mutants used in this study (Fig. 6C, lane 10 and Fig. 6D, lane  8) . These data suggest that the C158S mutation significantly affected M-N interaction, and that the 218LL/AA and M-FLAG mutations at the M carboxyl-terminal tail prevented N from viral incorporation during M-directed virion morphogenesis, even though they did not significantly affect M-N interaction. To determine whether the intracellular association between mutant M and N leads to VLP formation, cells coexpressing N and either wt or mutant M were observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM). As expected, numerous VLPs were observed localized in the perinuclear areas of cells coexpressing wt M and N (Fig. 7, panels A and B) , which is consistent with a previous report [16] . Intracytoplasmic vesicles containing VLPs were also observed (Fig. 7A, arrowheads) . Further, we noted VLPs near the nuclei of cells coexpressing N and secretion-defective W91A (Fig. 7D ). VLPs were also detectable in cells coexpressing N and Y94A, F95L or P58A M mutants (Figs. 7E-7I). Figure 5 shows culture supernatants collected from cotransfectants 24 or 48 h post-transfection. At 24 h, spherical particles approximately 100 nm in diameter were observed in wt M and N cotransfectant samples (Fig. 7J) , which is consistent with previous results. In contrast, VLPs from cells coexpressing N and P58A were undetectable or barely detectable until 48 h post-transfection (Fig. 7K) . Also at 24 h post-transfection, medium samples containing P58A plus N cotransfectants were almost identical to the mock-transfected sample-that is, we detected some vesicles, but no VLPs (Fig. 7L) . VLPs were barely detectable in culture supernatants derived from cells expressing N plus W91A, Y94A, F95L/A, C158S or 218LL/AA. No VLPs were found in cells coexpressing 218LL/AA plus N, and no VLPs were detected during TEM observations of concentrated gradient fractions of cell lysates containing 218LL/AA and N. In contrast, all other secretion-defective M mutants were still capable of associating with N and subsequently forming some intracellular VLPs, despite being VLP release-defective. According to our results, the effects of SARS-CoV M mutations on VLP assembly are largely determined by the capability of M mutants to be released from cells. According to Siu et al. [40] , M expressed alone is barely secreted, and N coexpression is required for efficient M release from Vero E6 cells [40] . This observation may be due to different expression systems used in the two studies. It could be that 293T cells release and/or express SARS-CoV membrane proteins more efficiently than Vero E6 cells. This may partly explain why 293T cells produce VLP-associated spike (S) proteins at levels 28-fold higher than Vero E6 cells, as reported by Siu et al. [40] . Nevertheless, the capability of SARS-CoV M to self-assemble and release or to form VLPs with coexpressed N represents a convenient strategy for determining M-M and M-N interaction domains. M-C158S is defective in both secretion and N association, suggesting that C158 residue is important for SARS-CoV assembly. Although we did not detect any intermolecular disulfide linkages, there is still a possibility of intramolecular disulfide bonds occurring during M self-assembly or secretion, which would partly explain why the C158S mutation exerts a significant effect on M release. Evidence showing that secretion-defective SARS-CoV M mutants are capable of self-association or association with wt M supports the proposal that multiple M regions are involved in selfassociation [52] . The inability of the 218LL/AA or M-FLAG mutant to package N suggests that the M carboxyl-terminal tail domain is responsible for M-N interaction. At least three research teams have suggested that the coronavirus M carboxyl tail region is important for N association [26, 47, 50] . However, our GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiment results suggest that alanine substitutions for the highly conserved dileucine motif 218-LL-219 failed to significantly impact SARS-CoV M-N interaction; this finding agrees with data from yeast two-hybrid and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays [47] . Nal et al. [54] have proposed that SARS-CoV M recycles to Golgi complexes via endocytosis once it reaches the plasma membrane. Accordingly, substitution mutations at 218-LL-219, or a FLAG tagged at the carboxyl-terminus, may block M sorting or trafficking to the Golgi area, resulting in defective VLP formation. This scenario may partly explain why M-FLAG and 218LL/AA were capable of N association following the disruption of cellular compartments. The M carboxyl-terminal tail is also important for MHV assembly: the deletion of a single amino acid residue from the M carboxyl terminus acts as a significant barrier to VLP assembly [51, 52] . MHV VLP formation is dependent on coexpression with the E protein [10, 52] . Accordingly, impaired MHV VLP assembly due to a M carboxyl-terminal mutation is largely the result of a defect in M-E interaction [52] , whereas SARS-CoV M carboxylterminal mutations such as 218LL/AA and M-FLAG do not affect M self-assembly and release. In a previous study we observed that SARS-CoV E is also secretable into culture medium (unpublished results); this is in agreement with a report that levels of SARS-CoV VLPs formed by M plus N noticeably increased following E coexpression [40] . However, E coexpression did not significantly enhance the VLP yields of SARS-CoV M mutants (data not shown), suggesting that E is incapable of compensating for M mutants in terms of directing VLP assembly. With the exception of C158, we found that all of the identified amino acid residues deemed important for SARS-CoV M selfassembly were either proline or aromatic (e.g., tryptophan, phenylalanine or tyrosine). Aromatic residues have been shown to mediate the self-assembly of different soluble proteins via ,pi.-,pi. interactions between polar aromatic rings [55, 56, 57] . Aromatic side chains have been proposed as favoring intra-and inter-peptide electrostatic interaction contributing to protein secondary structure and stable protein-protein interaction [58] . One research team has demonstrated that an aromatic-X-Xaromatic motif located in the transmembrane (TM) domain of EpsM (a cholera toxin secretion protein) is essential for stabilizing TM dimerization [59] . It is likely that the SARS-CoV M aromatic-XX-aromatic motif (91-WXXY-94), which resides in the predictive second TM domain, serves a similar function in stabilizing M dimerization. In addition, a more recent study suggests that coronavirus M is capable of adopting two conformations associated with membrane curvature regulation [53] . Accordingly, the replacement of conserved aromatic residues with alanine or leucine may disrupt M conversion from one form to another, resulting in a membrane-bending defect. This scenario may partly account for decreased mutant VLP yields. It remains to be determined whether the other M aromatic residues are important for SARS-CoV assembly. Our preliminary study found that an alanine substitution at the highly conserved W54 exerted no detectable effect on SARS-CoV VLP assembly, suggesting that some conserved aromatic residues are not involved in that process. The replacement of SARS-CoV M codons W19, W57, W91, Y94 or F95 with other aromatic residues did not exert detrimental effects on VLP assembly. A future task is to determine if the same is true for other M aromatic residues. Codon optimized SARS-CoV M and N expression vectors were provided by G. J. Nabel [16] . A pair of upstream and downstream primers was used to amplify M-coding fragments via PCR-based overlap extension mutagenesis [60] with the SARS-CoV M expression vector serving as a template: the 59-GTCTGAGCAG-TACTCGTTGCTG-3 forward primer (referred to as the N primer) and the 59-GGAAAGGACAGTGGGAGTGGCAC-39 reverse primer. Oligonucleotide primers containing the substitution mutation codons were available on request. Purified PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRV and ligated into the SARS-CoV M expression vector. GST-N or HIV-1 Gag expression vector has been described elsewhere [61] . Cell Culture and Transfection 293T cells and HeLa were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO). Confluent cells were trypsinized and split 1:10 onto 10 cm dishes 24 h prior to transfection. For each construct, cells were transfected with 10 mg of plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method; 50 mm chloroquine was added to enhance transfection efficiency. Unless otherwise indicated, 5 mg of each plasmid was used for co-transfection. At 24-48 h post-transfection, supernatant from transfected cells was collected, filtered, and centrifuged through 2 ml of 20% sucrose in TSE (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA plus 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]) at 4uC for 40 min at 274,0006g. Pellets were suspended in IPB (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% sodium azide) plus 0.1 mM PMSF. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), collected in IPB plus 0.1 mM PMSF, and microcentrifuged at 4uC for 15 min at 13,7006g to remove unbroken cells and debris. Supernatant and cell samples were mixed with equal volumes of 2X sample buffer (12.5 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue) and 5% b-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min or (for the M-containing samples) incubated at 45uC for 10 min. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membrane-bound M and M-FLAG proteins were immunodetected using a SARS-CoV M rabbit anitserum (Rockland). For SARS-CoV N detection, a mouse monoclonal antibody [62] was used at a dilution of 1:5,000. The secondary antibody was a sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-(HRP) conjugated antibody (Invitrogen), both at 1:5,000 dilutions. Confluent HeLa cells were split 1:80 onto coverslips 24 h before transfection. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized at room temperature for 10 min in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 following fixation at 4uC for 20 min with 3.7% formaldehyde. Samples were incubated with a rabbit anti-SARS-CoV M or with a mouse anti-N monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h. A goat anti-rabbit rhodamineconjugated antibody or a rabbit anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Cappel, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Aurora, OH) at a 1:100 dilution for 30 min. Following each incubation, samples were subjected to three washes (5 to 10 min each) with DMEM/calf serum. After a final DMEM/calf serum wash, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS for viewing. Images were analyzed and photographs taken using the inverted laser Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope. Velocity Sedimentation Analysis of Cytoplasmic M Proteins Cells were rinsed twice with PBS, pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml TEN buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl) containing Complete protease inhibitor cocktail followed by homogenization using a sonicator. The cell lysates then were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 min at 4uC. Five hundred ml of the postnuclear supernatants were mixed with an equal amount of TEN buffer, and were then applied to the top of a pre-made 25-45% discontinuous sucrose gradient. This gradient was prepared in TEN buffer containing 1 ml of each of 25%, 35%, and 45% sucrose. The gradient was then centrifuged at 130,000 6g for 1 hour at 4uC. Five 0.8-ml fractions were collected from the top of the centrifuge tubes. The proteins present in aliquots of each fraction were precipitated with 10% TCA and subjected to western blot analysis as described in the membrane flotation assay. 293T cells transfected with FLAG-tagged M expression vector were collected in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and microcentrifuged at 4uC for 15 min at 13,7006g (14,000 rpm) to remove unbroken cells and debris. Aliquots of post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) were mixed with equal amounts of 2X sample buffer and held for Western blot analysis. Lysis buffer was added to the remaining PNS samples to final volumes of 500 ml, and each sample was mixed with 20 ml of anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma). All reactions took place at 4uC overnight on a rocking mixer. Immunoprecipitate-associated resin or bead-bound complexes were pelleted, washed tree times with lysis buffer, two times with PBS, eluted with 1X sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-10% PAGE as described above. Cross-linking reagent bis-maleido hexame (BMH; Pierce) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a 20 mM solution. Virus-like particles were prepared in PBS and aliquoted at 20-ml fractions that mock-treated with 1 ml DMSO or treated with 1 ml of 20 mM BMH in DMSO. Reaction mixtures were vortexed gently and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were mixed with equal volumes of 2X sample buffer and 5% bmercaptoethanol and incubated at 45uC for 10 min prior to electrophoresis. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and fixed in 0.1 M Cacodylate buffer containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed with 1% osium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Spurr resin. Thin section was cut with an ultramicrotome, stained with 5% uranyl acetate and 0.4% lead citrate. Concentrated viral samples were placed onto carbon-coated, UV-treated 200 mesh copper grids for 2 min. Sample-containing grids were rinsed for 15 secs in water, dried with filter paper, and stained for 1 min in filtered 1.3% uranyl acetate. Excess staining solution was removed by applying filter paper to the edge of each grid. Grids were allowed to dry before viewing with a JOEL JEM-2000 EXII transmission electron microscope. Images were collected at 20,0006 and 60,0006.

       "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the most prevalent cause of viral encephalitis worldwide. More than 67,900 cases of JE are reported annually, among which approximately 30% are fatal and 50% suffer from permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae (Wang and Liang, 2015) . JEV infection causes devastating and fatal neuroinflammation characterized by neuronal destruction accompanied with intense microgliosis, strogliosis, and production of various inflammatory cytokines (Biswas et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2010) . Neurons can be destroyed directly by JEV infection and indirectly by inflammation mediated cytotoxicity (Ghoshal et al., 2007; Myint et al., 2014) . Then the massive neuronal death contributes to the progression and deterioration of Japanese encephalitis (JE) (Myint et al., 2014) . Necroptosis is a newly discovered pathway of programmed cell death (Galluzzi and Kroemer, 2008) . Unlike the uncontrolled accidental cell death, necroptosis is regulated by classical necrosome comprising receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3, mixed-lineage kinase domainlike protein (MLKL) through TNF/TNFR1 signaling or other stimuli (Vandenabeele et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012; Vanden et al., 2014) . In addition, DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors (DAI) is also identified to induce the RIPK1-independent RIPK3-dependent necroptosis by recognizing viral double-stranded DNA and recruiting RIPK3 directly through the RHIM domain (Upton et al., 2012; Sridharan and Upton, 2014; Kuriakose et al., 2016) . MLKL is the executor of necroptosis after being recruited and phosphorylated by RIPK3. MLKL recruits Ca 2+ and Na + ion channels and form pores at the plasma membrane, leading to the rupture of cells. (Cai et al., 2014; Dondelinger et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014) . Massive damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from the disintegrated cells trigger inflammatory response (Kaczmarek et al., 2013) . Overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α) from activated microglia exposed to DAMPs may induce more cell death which forms the vicious cycle of necroptosisinduced inflammation (Pasparakis and Vandenabeele, 2015) . Previous studies have identified that apoptosis and autophagy are involved in the neuronal loss of JE, which are reported to be effective intervention targets to alleviate the progression of JE (Sharma et al., 2014; Lyoo et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2016) . Besides, massive neuronal necrosis is also observed in the human fatal cases and animal models of JEV infection. During JE, TNFα is the main culprit in the neurotoxic cascade and provokes glial activation as well as subsequent neuroinflammation . Interestingly, TNF-α is just the classical initiator of necroptosis through TNF-α/TNFR1/RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL signaling in many central nervous system (CNS) diseases (Cai et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014) . Necroptosis was also reported to be activated during viral infection such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), influenza A virus (IAV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) by death cytokines such as TNF or virus itself (Upton et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2015; Kuriakose et al., 2016) . However, it is still unknown whether necroptosis was involved in the development of JE. In this study, we found that MLKL mediated necroptosis was activated in JE and MLKL deleted mice showed ameliorated progression of JE compared with wild mice. Taken together, this study provides direct evidence for the roles of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of JEV infection. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University. The MLKL +/− C57BL/6 mice were kind gifts from Professor Jiahuai Han and Dr. Jianfeng Wu (State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology and School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University) and were kept in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) facility. New-born mice toe DNA samples were amplified through PCR with PrimeStar (Takara, Japan) and the products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis for the screening of WT, MLKL +/− , MLKL −/− descendants (Wu et al., 2013) . To build the JEV infected models, Wild and MLKL −/− mice (4-6 W) were administered with JEV 5 × 10 7 PFU/20 g in 200 µl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) intraperitoneally. For the control, 200 µl PBS was injected intraperitoneally. JEV SA-14 strain was propagated in the mosquito cell line C6/36. The supernatant containing JEV was concentrated as follows, the supernatant of JEV-infected C6/36 cell was collected and centrifuged at 8,000 g for 30 min at 4 • C to remove the cell debris. Next, the supernatant was ultra-centrifuged at 40,000 g for 4 h at 4 • C and the viral pellet was resuspended with PBS at 100:1 (supernatant: suspension) after removing the supernatant thoroughly. After being filtered through 0.22 µm filters, the virus suspension was titrated by conventional plaque assay and stored at −80 • C (Lee et al., 2014) . The neuroblast cell line Neuro2a was bought from ATCC and kept in DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). The immune-electron microscopy was performed as described (Fan et al., 2016) . Briefly, at 5 days post infection (dpi), mice were anesthetized with 2% pentobarbital sodium (0.1 ml/10 g body weight) and perfused with 0.01 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) containing 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 30 min. The brains were removed and fixed in the 4% PFA for 3 h. Tissue sections of 50 µm were prepared with a vibratome and cryoprotected by 30% sucrose. After one freeze-thaw treatment, the sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 5% normal goat serum for 4 h, then incubated with anti-MLKL antibody (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for 24 h, after rinsed thoroughly and then incubated with goat anti-rat IgG conjugated to 1.4 nm gold particles (1:100, Nanoprobes) at room temperature (RT) overnight. After rinsing three times, the sections were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for 45 min. Silver enhancement was performed in the dark with an HQ Silver Kit (Nanoprobes) for 15 min. The sections were further fixed with 0.5% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated with graded ethanol, replaced with propylene oxide, and flat-embedded in Epon 812. The MLKL-immunoreactive areas were selected, trimmed under a stereomicroscope and mounted onto blank resin stubs for ultrathin sectioning. Ultrathin sections (70-80 nm) were prepared on an LKB Nova Ultratome (Bromma). After being counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, the sections were examined under a JEM-1230 electron microscope (JEM, Japan). Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining In vivo PI (4 mg/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was prepared in 0.9% NaCl. At 5 dpi, mice were administered with PI intraperitoneally (100 µl/20 g weight). One hour later, mice were anesthetized with 2% pentobarbital sodium and then perfused with 0.01 M PBS (50 ml) followed by 4% PFA for 30 min. Protected from light, the brains were removed and fixed in the 4% PFA for 3 h subsequently cryoprotected by 30% sucrose for 48 h. Brain sections of 10 µm were prepared with a vibratome and the nuclei were counterstained by DAPI (100 ng/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). At 5 dpi, mice were anesthetized with 2% pentobarbital sodium and then perfused with 0.01 M PBS followed by 4% PFA for 30 min. The brains were removed and fixed in the 4% PFA for 3 h subsequently cryoprotected by 30% sucrose for 48 h. Tissue sections of 10 µm were prepared with a vibratome. After being fixed with 4% PFA and blocked with 3% BSA containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the slides were incubated with primary antibodies anti-NeuN (abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-JEV (prepared in our lab), and anti-MLKL (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) diluted with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA for 16 h. After washing, the sections were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies (see Supplementary Table 1) for 1 h at RT. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and coverslips were placed on the samples with 50% glycerol in PBS. Neuro2a cells were plated in 24-well plates containing glass slides at the density of 6 × 10 4 /well overnight. Then cells were infected with JEV (MOI = 1). After adsorption for 1 h, the virus suspension was removed, and fresh DMEM was added. After 24 h, the slides were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min and blocked with 3% BSA for 1 h. Then IHC was conducted for MLKL and JEV as above. Neuro2a cells were plated in 6-well plates at the density of 2 × 10 5 /well in DMEM containing 10% FBS overnight. Then cells were infected with JEV as above at different MOI (0.1, 1, and 5) and harvested at different time points (12, 24, 48 h after infection) for qRT-PCR and western blotting. WT and MLKL −/− mice were euthanatized and perfused with PBS at 5 dpi, then whole brain of each mouse was harvested and stored at −80 • C. Total RNA from mouse brains and Neuro2a cells was extracted with RNAfast1000 (PIONEER, China). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription with the total RNA as template using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Japan), qRT-PCR experiments were carried out using SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each quantitative PCR reaction was performed in triplicate and the mean threshold cycle (Ct) value for each sample was used for data analysis. The level of mRNA expression was normalized with β-actin.

Total protein from the brain of each mouse or Neuro2a cells was extracted with RIPA buffer and quantified using a Protein Reagent Assay BCA Kit (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA). Thirty micrograms of protein from each sample was loaded and electrophoresed using 10% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After being blocked with 3% BSA at RT for 60 min, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies anti-MLKL (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), pMLKL (abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and β-actin (Proteintech, China) overnight at 4 • C. Then, the blots were incubated with secondary antibody (see Supplementary Table 1) for 2 h at RT. The blots were visualized using an Infrared Imaging System (Odyssey, LI-COR, NE Lincoln, USA). Serum was collected from each mouse of each group at 5 dpi. The level of IL-1β, CCL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α was tested with Mouse ELISA Kit (AMEKO, China) and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The concentration was determined according to the standard curve. All statistical analyses used GraphPad Prism version 6.01 software. Statistical differences were determined using the Student's t-test. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant ( * P < 0.05, * * P < 0.01, and * * * P < 0.001). It is known that JEV infection causes neuronal cell death directly by JEV infection and indirectly by inflammation mediated cytotoxicity. Besides apoptosis, neuronal necrosis is also found in autopsy tissues from human fatal cases (German et al., 2006) . Compared with the orderly disassembly of apoptotic cells, necrotic cells are disintegrated accompanied with massive release of DAMPs, which can trigger more serious inflammation (Kaczmarek et al., 2013) . In this study, necrosis was detected in mice infected with JEV at 5 dpi through PI staining and electron microscopy. At 5 dpi, massive antigen of JEV was detected in JEV infected mouse brains (see Supplementary Figure 1 ). There were a large number of PI positive cells in the brain sections of JEV infected mice compared with PBS treated mice (Figures 1A,B) . In the microstructure of brain cells, there were many cells showing classical necrotic morphology with clumps of chromatin, swollen mitochondria and plasma membrane disintegration in JEV infected group ( Figure 1C) . As a result, nerve cells underwent massive necrotic cell death in the murine model of JE. MLKL is the marker and executor of necroptosis. There was significantly increased expression of TNF-α after JEV infection in vivo and in vitro in our study (Supplementary Figure 2) , which was in accordance with previous reports. Since TNFα is the classical initiator of necroptosis through TNFα/TNFR1/RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL signaling (Cai et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014) , we detected the expression of MLKL in mice brain to identify whether MLKL mediated necroptosis was involved in JE. The MLKL around the plasma membrane was obvious in the brain sections of JEV infected mice while it was invisible in control mice (Figure 2A) . Granules immunostained with anti-MLKL antibody were localized to the plasma membrane in the cortex of JEV infected mice according to the immune-electron microscopy ( Figure 2B) . Meanwhile, there was increased protein level of MLKL and pMLKL in JEV infected mice ( Figure 2C) . The level of MLKL mRNA was also increased in JEV infected group compared to the PBS treated mice ( Figure 2D) . Interestingly, the mice showing more serious clinical symptoms were detected to be higher in the level of MLKL mRNA (see Supplementary Figure 3 ). All these results demonstrated that MLKL mediated necroptosis was involved in JE. Neuronal death played crucial roles in the pathogenesis of JE. To test whether necroptosis occurs in the neurons, the doublestaining with MLKL and NeuN (the marker of neurons) was carried out in mouse brains. As expect, the upregulation of MLKL were mostly occurred in NeuN-labeling cells ( Figure 3A) . This indicated that MLKL mediated necroptosis mainly occurred in neurons during JEV infection. Meanwhile, there were also co-localization of JEV and MLKL in the cytoplasm of the neurons ( Figure 3B ) which was also observed in the cell line Neuro2a cells ( Figure 4A ). It has been shown that MLKL is a mediator of necroptosis. To investigate whether the upregulation of MLKL expression was caused by JEV infection, the immunostaining of MLKL and JEV in Neuro2a cells was conducted. In vitro, there was visible increased expression of MLKL in Neuro2a cells infected with JEV compared with control ( Figure 4A) . Furtherly, the expression of MLKL in mRNA (Figures 4B,C) and protein level (Figures 4D,E) were upregulated accompanying the increase of JEV infection time and dose. In summary, JEV infection promoted the expression of MLKL. To explore the role of MLKL in the progression of JE in vivo. MLKL knock-out mice were infected with JEV, the The behavior score was recorded twice every day according to the scoring criteria (0 = no piloerection, no restriction of movement, no body stiffening, no hind limb paralysis. 1 = piloerection, no restriction of movement, no body stiffening, no hind limb paralysis. 2 = piloerection, restriction of movement, no body stiffening, no hind limb paralysis. 3 = piloerection, restriction of movement, body stiffening, no hind limb paralysis. 4 = piloerection, restriction of movement, body stiffening, hind limb paralysis. 5 = piloerection, restriction of movement, body stiffening, hind limb paralysis, sometimes tremor even death. And the dead mice were excluded from the cohort and the mean scores of all mice in each group were calculated. The data represent the mean ± SD). MLKL −/− mice showed slowed onset and progression of JE compared with wild group. (C) The death and survival of mice in each group was recorded and the data was analyzed and shown as Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Even though there was no significant difference in the final survival rate, MLKL −/− group survived for longer time than wild group. In the MLKL mediated necroptosis, massive DAMPs released from the disintegrated cells trigger and accelerate inflammation. To explore the change of inflammation between wild and MLKL −/− mice after JEV infection, the level of some inflammatory cytokines in the serum ( Figure 6A ) and brain ( Figure 6B ) at 5 dpi were tested. There was decreased level of IL-1β, CCL-2, IFN-γ in the serum of MLKL −/− mice compared with wild mice. The level of TNF-α also showed decline to some extent, even though without statistically significant difference. The expression of CCL-2, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNFα were decreased in the brains of MLKL −/− mice than wild mice. The decreased inflammation might contribute to the alleviated progression of JE. At the same time, the death of neuron was also diminished in MLKL −/− mice at 5 dpi (see Supplementary Figure 4) . However, there was no significant difference of the viral load in the brain between MLKL −/− and wild mice (see Supplementary Figure 5) . Thus, MLKL mediated necroptosis worsened the inflammation during the JEV infection. Neuronal death plays fatal roles in the progression of neuroinflammation during JEV infection, among which apoptosis and autophagy have been demonstrated to be involved in. The neurons can directly undergo apoptosis due to viral replication or through a bystander mechanism where overactivation of microglia and astrocytes leads to the release of numerous proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (Swarup et al., 2007) . The existence of massive neuronal necrosis in the human fatal cases and animal models has also been reported. Recently, it was found that necroptosis also participated in many CNS diseases (Dhib-Jalbut and Kalvakolanu, 2015; Ito et al., 2016; Meessen-Pinard et al., 2017) . It can be triggered by the TNF family of cytokines and by ligands of Toll-like receptors 3 and 4 (Vandenabeele et al., 2010) . However, it is still unclear whether the necroptosis, as a particular form of necrosis, participates in the pathology of JE. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that MLKL mediated necroptosis was involved in the pathogenesis of JE. Meanwhile, the expression of MLKL was increased during JEV infection. MLKL −/− mice showed delayed onset of JE, alleviated symptoms and decreased neuroinflammation and proinflammatory cytokines compared with wild mice after JEV infection. Currently, the research of necroptosis pathway is mainly focused on TNF/TNFR/RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL and RIPK1 independently DAI/RIPK3/MLKL signaling. As reported, production of TNF-α and stimulation of TLRs participated in the initiation of MLKL mediated necroptosis (Vandenabeele et al., 2010) . During JEV infection, there is robust production of TNF-α, which might trigger the necroptosis. Many approaches have been developed to assess the contribution of necroptosis in experimental disease models such as detection of micromorphological and biochemical features, measurement of MLKL expression, assessment of phosphorylated MLKL level and so on, among which MLKL phosphorylation has been used as a diagnostic biomarker . In this study, we detected MLKL around the neuron membrane from JEV-infected mice and the increased expression of MLKL and pMLKL in JEV infected mice and cells. Meanwhile, the mRNA level of MLKL was also increased after JEV infection. In general, we proved the existence of MLKL mediated necroptosis during JE. Interestingly, we also found that the increased expression of MLKL was mainly occurred in JEV infected cells in vitro and in vivo. We speculate that JEV infection might induce the expression of MLKL and several host factors might promote the phosphorylation of MLKL at the same time. However, the exact trigger and signal of MLKL phosphorylation during JEV infection is still under investigation. It has been established that necroptosis restricts propagation and spread of lytic virus such as HSV-1 and IAV by eliminating the infected cells as well as exaggerating inflammatory response (Huang et al., 2015; Kuriakose et al., 2016; Nogusa et al., 2016) . While, as reported, there was no significantly difference in the viral load between WT and necroptosis blocking mice infected with IAV until 6 dpi (Kuriakose et al., 2016) . In our study, the viral load between wild and MLKL −/− mice after direct injection 50 PFU JEV into the brains showed no significant difference (see Supplementary Figure 6 ) before they gradually died. Thus, necroptosis alone was not enough to restrict JEV spread in vivo. Conversely, necroptosis and inflammation promoted each other and caused more serious CNS disorders and death during JE. JE is characterized with extensive neuroinflammation. Until now, there is no special or effective therapy but symptomatic relief and supportive treatment (Misra and Kalita, 2010) . The DAMPs, activated glia, inflammatory cytokines and breakdown of BBB forming an uncontrolled damaged microenvironment lead to excessive neuronal death, brain dysfunctions, cerebral edema and respiratory failure, which is the main cause of death during JE (Han et al., 2014) . Blocking the vicious cycle of inflammatory damage has been shown to benefit the therapy of JE (Ye et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015) . Recently, necroptosis has been demonstrated to lead to disruption of cell membranes and release of cytoplasmic contents which triggers and exacerbates inflammation response (Silke et al., 2015) . Several studies have shown that suppression of necroptosis can alleviate inflammation induced injury. Kuriakose et al. (2016) reported that blocking necroptosis could reduce inflammatory responses and epithelial damage and protect mice from mortality during IAV infection. Consistently, in our study, MLKL −/− mice showed delayed onset of JE and alleviated symptoms compared with wild mice after JEV infection. It indicated that MLKL mediated necroptosis aggravated the progression of JE. Although MLKL −/− mice did not survive from JE totally, we found that MLKL −/− mice showed decreased level of CCL-2, IL-1β, IFN-γ in brain and serum compared with wild mice after JEV infection. Thus, the slowing of JE progression in MLKL −/− mice could be attributed to the interruption of the vicious cycle of necroptosis-induced inflammation. In summary, our study indicated that MLKL mediated necroptosis was involved in the pathogenesis of JE. Targeting necroptosis may provide new ways to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of JEV induced encephalitis.

The brains of mice were harvested at 2, 4, 6 dpi after JEV infection intraperitoneally and the RNA of the whole brain was extracted and the level of TNF-α was detected through qRT-PCR (PBS = 2, 2 dpi = 2, 4 dpi = 2, 6 dpi = 4). And Neuro2a cells were collected after JEV infection at different MOI (0.1, 1, and 5) and infection time (12, 24, and 48 h) for the detection of TNF-α (The data represent the mean ± SEM for 3 independent experiments).

       "Soon after starting research I learnt for myself how difficult it might be to detect a 'new' cold virus. In the early 1950s in the laboratories of the Rockefeller Institute in New York, I had just found out how to make roller tube tissue cultures which would support the growth of influenza viruses. I took some of these cultures and inoculated washings from a patient with a cold. After a few days a cytopathic effect appeared and I was all excitement, only to discover shortly afterwards that the cultures had a low grade infection with a cytotoxic bacterium. I discarded the experiment and got on with other work. In due course I returned to the UK, was appointed to the staff of the Medical Research Council (MRC) and worked in Sheffield on respiratory viruses, such as adenoviruses and infuenza; but circumstances led me to join the work on poliovirus vaccines and on the role of recently cultivated enteroviruses, all of which seemed to take me further and further from respiratory viruses. But I was then asked to work at the Common Cold Unit, Salisbury. In one way this meant that my outlook had to be much narrower, but in another it broadened greatly the possible approaches. I could now prepare pools of filtered nasal washings from individuals infected with clinical material, and thus had a documented stock of viruses which could not be propagated in the laboratory. We could also use the volunteers as a specific and sensitive test for the presence of a common cold virus. Thus we systematically tested for the growth of viruses in tissue cultures by inoculating culture medium as nasal drops into groups of volunteers living in isolation and observing whether they developed colds or not. But how did it come to pass that there was a Common Cold Unit at all, and was it really a good idea to have one? Colds and minor respiratory catarrhal illnesses must have been occurring for centuries, and are mentioned in diaries and literature. Late in the 19th century, with the rise of bacteriology, colds were actively investigated with the newly developed methods. Indeed by the 1930s it took a volume of 710 pages to summarize the published investigations but the virus theory was dismissed in only nine of them (Thomson and Thomson, 1932) . Some of the results reported seem bizarre these days but it is possible to guess at how some of them were obtained. For instance it seems that some workers did not distinguish clearly between the early acute illness and subsequent catarrh, sinusitis and secondary bacterial infections. Of course, good methods were available to culture and characterize common organisms such as pneumococci, haemophilus species and streptococcus haemolyticus, but there was much confusion with other organisms such as Neisseria and, as we would now call them, Branhamella. Anaerobic bacteriology was also beginning and gram-negative filter-passing anaerobes were alleged to exist. As a result a wealth of possible causative organisms were cultured. Even when it was realised that some bacteria might be harmless symbionts, it was possible to convince oneself that certain organisms appeared in the pharynx more frequently in colds than in good health. One study tackled this problem with really careful bacterial assessment, and a careful and impartial experimental design for collecting clinical records and bacterial specimens (Mills et al., 1928) . This concluded that although these anaerobic bacteria came and went in the airways they were a heterogeneous group and their presence was not related in time or quantity to the occurrence of cold symptoms. It is easy to look back at those studies with the confidence engendered by a view down the 'retrospectoscope' and see them clearly as a decisive observation. However, in the context of the time one can imagine how much authors might be influenced by confusion over whether filtrates transmitted colds and if they did what it meant. Powerful evidence was also being collected at the same time to show that haemolytic streptococci were associated with pharyngitis and many of its complications and that certain serotypes of pneumococci were unquestionably linked to pneumonia. After all it is less than ten years since we lived through a similar but brief period of confusion, claims and counter-claims until the HIV virus was cultured and its relationship to AIDS was documented. In fact specific evidence that viruses caused colds had been obtained long before the 1930s by the appropriate methods of the time. Kruse published in 1914 in the Munich Medical Weekly the results of an experiment in which he passed nasal washings through a bacteria-tight filter, inoculated it into volunteers and observed colds. This result was overlooked, possibly in part because of the outbreak of war, but it was also discredited because his volunteers were not isolated and so a few who were given uninfected material nevertheless developed colds; there was also the question of whether filtration through Seitz filters or Berkefield candles would remove all bacteria. These needed to be carefully checked to ensure that they did hold back all bacteria and this could be done as a control test. Indeed it may be because these tests were not properly done or interpreted, that it was believed by many that anaerobic organisms could exist in a filterable form. In my view the best attempt to resolve this confusing situation was made by Dochez's group at the Rockefeller Institute (Dochez et al., 1930) where they very carefully filtered nasal secretions and checked that they were bacteria-free and showed that they produced colds when given to chimpanzees or human beings held in strict isolation (which was shown to prevent colds in uninoculated subjects). However, further problems lay ahead. Having shown that colds really could be due to viruses the same group then set out to culture the virus using the technology of the day, namely cultures of chopped chick embryo tissue, held under a layer of paraffin (Dochez et al., 1931) : they believed they could produce colds with such material. C.H. Andrewes (personal communication) tried to repeat this experiment in England, and even brought cultures from New York by ship, but failed to get convincing data, and concluded that the results were due to irritation produced by autolysed tissue. However, the studies on the viral nature of colds were well designed and executed and although they did not immediately convince all those in the field they stood the tests of time and repetition and caused the edifice of studies of bacterial 'causes' of colds to be weakened and eventually to crumble. It would be an interesting piece of social and historical research to define the thoughts and beliefs and the social background which led to the founding of the Common Cold Unit at Salisbury, UK in 1946. We know that there were unanswered scientific questions and that C.H. Andrewes, already known for passing human influenza virus to ferrets (Smith et al., 1933) , was anxious to do more experiments on colds using human volunteers in a similar way. Furthermore the old American Red Cross/Harvard Hospital site had lain vacant since the US Army had left it empty when they moved their pathology laboratory to Paris. But there were very few virologists in the UK, the country had desperate economic problems in the rebuilding of millions of damaged homes, repairing and re-equipping factories and generally developing an effective peacetime economy. Yet at the same time there was a general hope for a better country and a better life in the post-war years. Perhaps it was also believed that the task was simpler than it really was: that some months or years of research would reveal 'the' common cold virus against which a vaccine would be made (Andrewes, 1949) . War-time experience had also given rise to the belief that so-called 'minor' infections could significantly reduce production, and it was perceived that this would be important in peacetime too. Whatever the truth may have been, a joint plan was formulated in early 1946 -the Ministry of Health would support the accommodation of the volunteers, up to 20 or 30 each two weeks, the Medical Research Council would fund the laboratory work and staff, and the Ministry of Works would look after the buildings and the basic services. In a matter of a few months the buildings were converted, a small staff was assembled and in July of the same year the first group of seven student volunteers arrived to be the subjects for the first of a series of trials which continued without a break for 43 years and involved almost 20000 visits to the Unit, and over 18 000 individuals. One then has to ask certain questions. Was it really a good idea? Was it worth it? Would research have gone on equally well without it? Such questions are in many ways unanswerable. It is always important to clear away unsound research reports when starting in a new field, and we may at this distance not value adequately the early work done, without much publicity, to show that the cold virus could not be induced by chilling, and could not be transmitted to animals such as cats, or passaged successfully in embryonated eggs as had been claimed by previous workers (Andrewes, 1951) . Then there were the first, and very careful, experiments to show the passage of a virus in cultures of human embryo lung, as used by Enders and colleagues in their first experiments on polioviruses (Andrewes et al., 1953) . The virus grown is now known to be a rhinovirus type 9 but was then called 'the' common cold virus. Of course rhinovirus 1 a was grown away from the Unit by applying to respiratory specimens other techniques developed from those of Enders, i.e. roller tube cultures of monkey kidney cell cultures and observation of a cytopathic effect (Price, 1956; Pelon et al., 1957) . However it is my guess that the development of general methods using tissue cultures, and later organ cultures, of cells, was generally faster and more logical at the Unit where we were able to combine the use of new culture techniques with the inoculation of volunteers to indicate that a cold-producing agent was growing to even a limited extent. We first found a method for propagating many different 'cold' (actually rhino-)-viruses in roller tube cultures of human embryo kidney cells at 33°C for two passages, without a cytopathic effect (CPE) . The medium was modified, first to allow serial passage and the development of interference, and then to allow a rapid CPE to occur (Tyrrell and Parsons, 1960; Hitchcock and Tyrrell, 1960) . Others later found more convenient susceptible cells. Once fully developed, these methods could be used in any laboratory, the biology and drug sensitivity of viruses could be studied anywhere and their presence in clinical material and their relationship to disease either in volunteers or in the community could be determined. Furthermore, the old empirical idea of the existence of 'the common cold virus' was soon replaced by data collected by epidemiologically controlled field studies in which infection was detected with a range of viruses following which their pathogenicity was confirmed and studied by inoculating them into volunteers and observing their effects. These studies proved that typical colds could be produced by a wide range of viruses including some enteroviruses and paramyxoviruses, but certain viruses, namely rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were the main causes of colds and thus could be used as laboratory reagents in the search for specific antiviral treatments. Thus, after years of frustration the work of the Unit developed to the point where relevant human infections could be produced at will and precisely documented by clinical and laboratory methods -this was the ideal setting for preliminary trials of the efficacy of antiviral drugs or vaccines without which nowadays it would rarely be justifiable to go on to a field study of naturally acquired colds. As time went on the Unit also played a role in providing a continuing focus for work on subjects, such as the spread and pathogenesis of colds and antiviral treatment, which went in and out of fashion. For instance early experiments on the use of interferon for the prophylaxis of colds had to face various problems. Once we had even small amounts of human interferon (Sutton and Tyrrell, 1961) we could show in vitro that it would render human cells resistant to a wide range of viruses capable of causing colds, but there was a general view that such treatment would never protect the respiratory epithelial cells, defended as they are by the mucociliary apparatus. Furthermore the first interferon preparations were of very low potency. Later chemically synthesized antivirals were also disappointing, but interferon experiments continued with purer and more potent preparations until 1973 when the idea of antivirais for the treatment of colds finally came of age and rhinovirus-induced colds were prevented at the Unit by spraying human leucocyte interferon intranasally (Merigan et al., 1973) . This result was confirmed and shown to be due to interferon itself when colds were prevented with leucocyte interferon which had been purified by means of monoclonal antibody (Scott et al., 1982a) or synthesized in E. coli by recombinant DNA technology (Scott et al., 1982b) . This work has been expanded by other groups and early trials are reviewed by Scott and Tyrrell (1985) . The continued existence of at least a few test sites in the world encouraged research to continue on antivirals until eventually a chemically synthesized molecule was detected which also had a clear-cut beneficial effect against colds . After further development such drugs will no doubt be studied in the community as interferon has been. There is a common view that the time for such work has passed, that such specialized expertise and resources are not needed, that high technology is all that is required to provide further advances. It is of course important to ensure that research on colds, or any other infection, exploits the contributions of the best current laboratories and their equipment -electron microscopy in the '60s and molecular biology in the '80s. Such methods greatly increase the power of the science but are not able to answer crucial questions on whether new molecules provide benefit to humans, and how they can be applied. In the absence of an animal model and in the face of the multiplicity of causative viruses, it is important to have a 'half-way house' between the test tube and studies of natural colds to identify promising drugs and find out how to use them clinically (Beare and Reed, 1977) . Important elements of this are the willingness of the public to help, a place where they like to come for the experiments and the invisible relationships built up with the experimental team. It will be essential to reproduce these if successful experiments of this sort are to be done in the future. Advances in the detection of viruses and antibodies have also been used to study other aspects of respiratory infections in man. It was possible to use the volunteer resources to study and measure the pathogenicity and immunogenicity for man of influenza viruses modified in various ways, for example, by serial passage in eggs or mice and reassortment with epidemic strains, with a view to developing live attenuated vaccines; such work complemented that done in the USA and USSR and has continued up to recent years and now includes the detailed molecular analysis of the candidate viruses (Beare, 1975; Nicholson et al., 1987; Oxford et al., 1990) . It was also possible to document the way viruses damage cilia and slow mucociliary transport (Wilson et al., 1989) to look for the role of atopy and possible mediators in producing respiratory symptoms (Callow et al., 1988) and to document local physiological parameters such as nasal blood flow (Bende et al., 1989) . Psychological factors, such as personality and 'stress' were also found to be important. It was possible to use volunteers with colds as a mild but definable 'organic' disease in which one could document quite rigorously (Totman et al., 1980; Cohen et al., 1991) effects which very probably occur in other less common but more serious diseases, but which could not be studied experimentally for ethical and practical reasons. Other experiments showed that human performance is impaired by colds and influenza (e.g. Smith et al., 1988a ) and a start was made in looking for the role of virus-induced humoral factors such as interferon as mediators of these changes (Smith et al., 1988b) . These findings were not intended to lead to new treatments directly but complemented work done elsewhere to provide a fuller understanding of the disease, which in turn could open up new forms of treatment. They also provided a number of new techniques, such as neuropsychological performance tests, for the assessment of the systemic effects of the infection and for documenting the benefits of treatment. The Common Cold Unit was not the only group to be studying respiratory viruses in human volunteers. A young man, George G. Jackson, met Dr. Andrewes and visited the Salisbury Unit. He saw the possibility of using the climatic chamber at the University of Chicago to study the possible effects of chilling on colds (Dowling et al., 1958) . With Dr. H.F. Dowling and others he published the results of studies on many hundreds of volunteers (Dowling et al., 1957) . Unfortunately they were unable to isolate their volunteers and thus some of their work on the identity of the viruses they studied was not entirely clear, though they did pioneering work on the factors which influence susceptibility, on the effects of amantadine and on other topics. A great deal of excellent laboratory work was done at the NIH Bethesda MD, detecting new viruses in respiratory disease of childhood, for instance the para-influenza viruses by Chanock and his colleagues . Although it was very likely from the circumstances that they caused the diseases affecting the patients in which they were found, it was desirable to try and fulfil 'Koch's postulates' and show that the cultured virus would cause respiratory disease in man. Thus they were led to inoculate adults in room isolation and showed that they were infected and developed a disease which resembled a common cold, rather than the more severe lower respiratory disease which they found in children . The group also worked on rhinovirus colds, and used volunteers to do important early studies on the role of antibody in immunity to infection (Cate et al., 1964) . Another group at the NIH was able to exploit the technology developed as a result of concern with biological warfare. They generated accurately defined aerosols of various respiratory viruses and developed equipment to enable volunteers to inhale known amounts of these (see Knight, 1964) . Thus they could calculate the amount of virus delivered as an aerosol which was required to initiate an infection: furthermore they showed that when given as a fine aerosol, viruses which otherwise invade the upper airways and cause colds would invade the lower airways and cause lesions in the lungs and bronchi. When some of the group transferred to Baylor University in Texas they performed volunteer experiments in local prisons, for instance on live influenza vaccines. A continuing centre of volunteer work was set up in the University of Maryland, Baltimore. This group also worked with known viruses, and on a number of occasions performed studies on influenza viruses and candidate antiviral drugs (e.g. Togo, 1972) . In more recent years an outstanding centre was set up in the University of Virginia, Charlottesville under J. Gwaltney and F.G. Hayden. The group had a particular interest in rhinoviruses and studied them in the field. They also set up arrangements for using, at intervals, local resources, such as a motel, in which to conduct studies in which volunteers were rigorously isolated and studied clinically and virologically. They also had a high reputation for their work on antiviral treatment, and studied the effects of intranasal interferon etc. (see below). They showed by volunteer studies that it was possible to transmit rhinoviruses by contamination of fingers. However, the importance of this is still not decided (see below). On an occasional basis, E.C. Dick at the University of Wisconsin also set up volunteer experiments on the transmission of colds, some of which are mentioned later. All this work reached a peak in the 60's and 70's and had been significantly reduced by the late 80's. Nevertheless it was of great value that work went on in different centres. For one thing the numbers of volunteers in any one centre tended to be small. Though power calculations were not done in those days, we used, at the best, scores of subjects. Effects were sometimes modest and although they were apparently significant most of us felt much more comfortable about our conclusions when experiments had been repeated elsewhere with similar results. It was in fact remarkable how closely the results agreed at times, for instance on the clinical effects of para-influenza viruses or the protective effect of interferons. On other occasions hopeful results of trials with candidate drugs could not be repeated and so work moved on to others. Finally the existence of these groups created a sort of loosely-knit club. Key reagents were exchanged, results were discussed formally or informally on site, we learned from each other and many personal friendships were established. The reader will realise that the Common Cold Unit was set up at a time when the Nuremberg Trials and the Helsinki declaration were in the mind of the public and of experimental scientists. The Medical Research Council enunciated its own statement on studies in human beings some time later. Nevertheless, no formal review bodies existed for much of the Unit's life. However the type of experiment to be done was carefully considered by the Head Office. In addition when it was suggested that good conduct prisoners or servicemen might be recruited, it was decided that being under strong discipline they could not be considered as able to volunteer freely -though when they were on leave servicemen could come on the same basis as civilians if they wished, few did. All the volunteers made the first approach to the Unit, in response to media reports or personal recommendations, so there could be no undue pressure at that stage. They were sent a fairly full description of the Unit and the purpose and nature of the experiments, including the need to restrict their movements and contacts, and this was repeated and amplified if they finally came to the Unit -though many would-be volunteers never followed up their initial contacts. It was always true that volunteers might be dropped from trials. Some, for instance those who developed a quarantine cold, might stay on for their 'holiday' or leave early, but others, a small number, just left because they did not like the place. It was Unit policy not to use invasive procedures, and there were even long and serious discussions before it was finally decided to collect blood samples, at least for some studies. Furthermore, it was the policy not to administer any virus which might produce serious, let alone possibly lethal disease -thus although unmodified 'common cold' viruses were given, influenza viruses were always passaged in order to attenuate them. Thus the general principles that all volunteers should give their 'true' or 'free' and informed consent and that only non-hazardous experiments were acceptable were being applied before they were encoded in ethical committee rules and procedures. In spite of this careful approach some of the experiments done then would not be acceptable today. Extensive use was made of human embryo tissue -this was obtained from patients with no clinical history or evidence of infection and was handled in a 'clean' area. However it was tested only for bacterial and fungal infection before administration to volunteers. Furthermore on some occasions virus propagated in monkey kidney cells was used, and although the cultures were tested for haemadsorbing and cytopathic agents, we did not know about non-cytopathic organisms such as SV40 and so did not test for them. When local ethical committees were introduced we were able to comply with their requirements with no more difficulty than that occasioned by the extra paperwork. I remember that at the height of the controversy about 'human guinea pigs', I was in a public debate pitted against a very able and determined lady who took the line that all experiments on human beings are unethical and unsafe. At the end of the hour she summarized her views 'probably what you do Dr Tyrrell is alright, but I still think ..... '. Looking back one can see that our precautions were incomplete, due to lack of knowledge at the time, but the guidelines we were following in the conduct of the studies were sound and very close to those enunciated in a recent report of the Royal College of Physicians (1986). Common holds, like any other infectious disease, might be brought under control by intervening in a number of ways. These are to prevent transmission, enhance host immunity, limit virus replication, or prevent the unwanted effects on the hosts, i.e. symptoms and signs in the nose and elsewhere. All these have been tried in one way or another and in the following brief comments I summarize my current views on each and try to describe where I think they may lead theoretically or practically. In the early days the mode of transmission was only guessed at and my text book of medicine said that colds were transmitted by talking, sneezing or coughing. Work in the Unit and elsewhere suggested that colds had been transmitted from children to volunteers by the airborne route (Lovelock et al., 1952) but no techniques were available to detect virus in the air or to quantitate virus in the mixture of droplets ejected into the air by a sneeze. However, the nose collects particles from air during inspiration at the rate of about 10 litres per minute, but nevertheless transmission of infection is relatively infrequent (e.g. Hendley et al., 1969) . If each infection is initiated by the inhalation of one infectious unit, it is clear that a low concentration of such units in the air would be sufficient to explain the epidemiological findings. In volunteer studies with coxsackievirus A21 it was shown that colds could be transmitted from one end of a long room to the other when only air contact was possible (Couch et al., 1970) . We demonstrated how Coxsackie A21 virus, which is very like a rhinovirus, is shed as drops and droplets into the air by a subject with a cold and that similar droplets infect the nose efficiently when inhaled (Buckland et al., 1965) . However, there was very little virus in saliva and so little became airborne when talking. In 1973 Hendley and colleagues at the University of Virginia reported that virus could get onto the skin or fomites of patients with colds (Hendley et al., 1973) . We knew that virus could infect if placed onto the nasal mucosa by a contaminated swab or finger (Bynoe et al., 1961; Buckland et al., 1965) . Thus transmission by indirect contact would be possible. However, the really difficult question is how often this happens or rather what is the relative importance of transmission by the contact and the airborne route, and quantitative studies seemed to us to show that the finger route was relatively inefficient (Reed, 1975) . In recent careful experimental work, manual transmission in a group playing poker was prevented by using splints or large plastic collars; yet rhinovirus infection was freely transmitted, so the airborne route must have been of major importance in those circumstances (Dick et al., 1987) . Nevertheless in an earlier experiment they showed that viricidal tissues prevented transmission during an experimental poker game (Dick et al., 1986) . However, in order to test whether finger transmission was important in families, Gwaltney's group set up a placebo-controlled household study to block the transmission of rhinovirus colds through the fingers. This turned out to be a difficult experiment to conduct and although there was a trend in favour of the treated group there was no large or statistically significant overall effect (Farr et al., 1987) . Early work on the use of UV light in school classrooms showed that the transmission of measles could be slowed down by impeding airborne transmission, but neither this nor the use of viricidal tissues seem practical methods of preventing a substantial amount of transmission. Water treatment and food hygiene have had a profound effect on water and food-borne diseases. It seems unlikely that anything as successful can be developed for respiratory virus infections but, nevertheless, good ventilation and hand hygiene should be encouraged and are likely to do some good. (2) Host resistance Soon after the first rhinoviruses were cultured, a collaboration was set up to produce an inactivated vaccine against RV2. This was given intramuscularly to volunteers before they came to the Unit and they proved to be resistant to colds produced by intranasal challenge with live virus of the same serotype (Scientific Committee, 1965) . Although others believed secretory antibody to be of particular importance, we have done recent studies which show that circulating antibody (which was stimulated by the vaccine) is long-lasting and protects significantly against illness, although secretory antibody is effective in preventing infection (Rossen et al., 1966; Barclay et al., 1989) . Now that the sequence and structure of rhinoviruses is becoming better known, it is possible to identify possible linear peptide epitopes on the virus surface. This in turn suggests the possibility of searching for peptides which could be given as a killed vaccine to produce neutralising antibody (Francis et al., 1987) . Of course, there are many difficulties along the way, such as antigenicity, the need for Tcell epitopes, the variability of the human immune responsiveness etc., but the possibility of vaccination against rhinoviruses is worth exploring further. Indeed we have entered a new era in which the antigenic sites of two representative rhinoviruses types, 14 and la, have been mapped onto 3dimensional models of the virus particles (Rossman et al., 1985; Rossman0 1989; Appleyard et al., 1990) . They turn out to be located on the edges of the 'canyon' around the 5-fold symmetry axis of the particle. We have determined that human volunteers make antibodies against at least 3 such sites on rhinovirus type 2 identified by mouse monoclonal antibodies. Challenging the volunteers shows that the presence of such antibodies is associated with resistance to virus infection (Carey et al., 1992) . Many sites seem to be conformational, and a specific amino acid may be involved in the sites seen by more than one monoclonal antibody, so the problem is undoubtedly complex and more basic work is needed before sites on the edge of the 'canyon' can be fully identified and mimicked synthetically for one serotype, let alone for the 100-odd types now known. It has however already been suggested that it may be possible to generate neutralising antibody against the conserved sequences deeper in the 'canyon' which is the suspected site of interaction between the virus and the cell receptor (Rossman, 1989) . There has been more success in applying the discovery of interferons. The alpha and beta interferons (IFN~ and -fl) are produced by virus-infected cells and protect cells with which they come in contact by triggering the development of a state of resistance to virus infection. It is now well known that exogenous interferon, delivered as a nasal spray, protects the human from both experimental and naturally acquired common colds (see Scott and Tyrrell, 1985 which includes references to all other groups, in particular those at Charlottesville). However, in family studies it was effective only against rhinoviruses, and prolonged administration in doses big enough to protect gave rise to nasal symptoms such as mild nose bleeding, stuffiness, etc. Thus interferon cannot be used for continuous prophylaxis. This was found with IFN~2a, but there was some hope that IFNfl might show a different ratio between the concentrations giving protective and adverse effects, but this has not proved to be so. IFN gamma (IFN~) has also been tried at doses with equivalent antiviral effects in vitro. However, it had no beneficial prophylactic effects, indeed it seemed to make symptoms worse (Higgins et al., 1988) , possibly because it enhanced the production of virus receptors (ICAM-1) on the cell surface (see below). Nevertheless there are many more interferons and others can be generated by gene manipulation or synthesis. Some are being studied in the laboratory, and perhaps one will be found that is relatively less 'toxic' and so could be used for prophylaxis. One of the problems, however, is that there is no satisfactory laboratory test for the local inflammatory effect which is the 'toxic' effect that limits clinical use. Meantime attempts are being made to devise schedules by means of which the antiviral effect would be retained but the local adverse effect would be lost. However, it seems that once the dose has been reduced to the point when it produces no nasal symptoms it also has no detectable antiviral effect (Monto et al., 1989) . Prophylaxis could be useful in clinical practice under certain conditions, but it would be much better to be able to improve the course of colds by drugs administered after symptoms began, i.e. therapeutically. When natural and recombinant interferons were tested in this way against experimental influenza and rhinovirus infections in volunteers, they were no longer effective, possibly because by then the subject was already producing substantial amounts. Recently we have tried again with colds induced by RSV because it had been reported that RSV infections in children did not induce endogenous interferon, so that in this case added interferon might be expected to have an effect: unfortunately although IFN~ given prophylactically was highly effective, when given in maximum practicable doses immediately after symptoms appeared it conferred no benefit. A third approach to enhancing the host's immunity would be to use locally administered immunomodulators. These might be effective irrespective of the biological or serological type of virus, and might be free of the local adverse effects of interferons. We have recently investigated two of these. One was a muramyl dipeptide derivative which protected mice and guinea pigs when given in small doses intranasally prior to large doses of influenza viruses. However, when given in the maximum acceptable dose to volunteers it did not improve the clinical or laboratory parameters of experimental influenza, even though the strain used was partly attenuated and the dose given was not large . A thioguanosine derivative has been found which protects mice against coronavirus infection by enhancing their resistance (rather than by a direct antiviral effect) and this has also been studied in volunteers using colds induced by a coronavirus; analysis indicates that either it was given in too low a dose, or that it does not enhance the primate response in the same way as that of the rodent (Higgins et al., 1991) . In this field we are at a similar stage to that of work on interferons between 1957 and 1973 -we know that there are attractive theoretical possibilities but we do not know whether any such method can be made to work in man or what the 'benchmarks' for the properties of a candidate drug should be. As an expression of our belief in the possibility of antiviral treatment for colds, we tested a variety of antirhinovirus molecules derived from independent screening programmes, for example by the Wellcome Foundation (dichloroflavan) and Nippon Roche (an antiviral chalcone). It turned out that these all inactivated virus infectivity by binding to particles, and stabilized the particles against the effects of low pH and heat. The drugs were very potent when tested in vitro and when dichloroflavan was dissolved in oil and when a prodrug to the chalcone was developed they were well absorbed when given by mouth. Unfortunately they were not active in volunteers challenged with a sensitive rhinovirus, apparently because they did not enter nasal secretions, but they were still inactive when formulated as intranasal sprays (A1-Nakib et al., 1987a and b) . Furthermore a drug from Rhone-Poulenc with a related mode of action but more water-soluble had no effect either. While all this was going on there was a substantial programme of research on antipicornavirus drugs by the Sterling Winthrop group. This started with the discovery of the effect of arildone on enterovirus infectivity and led to the discovery of disoxaril and its many congeners. It was particularly important that Smith et al. (1986) studied crystals of rhinovirus soaked in disoxaril and showed that it bound to the virus capsid in a 'pocket' at the base of the 'canyon' round the 5-fold axis of virus symmetry -this region is probably involved with virus entry and uncoating. The Janssen Foundation was also looking for anti-rhinovirus drugs and evaluated many molecules, one of which was developed as a possible drug (R61837): 3-methoxy-6-[-4-(3-methylphenyl)-l-piperazinyl] pyrazidine (Andries et al., 1988) . This drug also bound to susceptible rhinoviruses and inactivated and stabilized them, and studies on drug-resistant mutants showed extensive cross-resistance, including dichloroflavan and disoxaril. This indicated that the site of action for this and the above-mentioned drugs was near to that of the Sterling Winthrop molecules (Dearden et al., 1989) . R61837 proved effective against rhinovirus type 9 in volunteers when given prophylactically as an intranasal spray and a series of 3 trials suggested a number of interesting conclusions (Barrow et al., 1990b) . (1) Unlike interferon, it .appeared that pretreatment was not important, but that if one discontinued treatment too early symptoms returned. (2) Treatment which began after infection but before symptoms appeared was effective, but treatment which began after symptoms appeared had no beneficial effect. (3) There were hints that volunteers given treatment until the colds in the controls had recovered (i.e. for six days) might subsequently develop colds after treatment was withdrawn, i.e. the drug was suppressive rather than curative. (4) In studies on volunteers given short courses of treatment virus shedding was apparently prolonged and drug resistance viruses could be recovered, particularly after the drug was withdrawn (Dearden et al., 1989) . Thus this type of antiviral treatment has quite different characteristics from those of say, intranasal interferon or of acyclovir against herpes virus, and much more research is needed. For one thing the molecule has very different activities against different serotypes of virus (we tested it against RV9 in volunteers because it had maximum activity in vitro against that serotype). For another thing more treatment regimes must be tried, in order to avoid return of symptoms and the appearance of drug-resistant viruses. Molecules with different antiviral spectra should be synthesized and investigated; they might be used in combination in order to produce a preparation which is active against a full range of serotypes, or it might be possible to exploit the synergism between different molecules which has been detected in vitro. In this area we can see real possibilities of 'designing' drugs or drug combinations (Ahmad and Tyrrell, 1986) . It is now known that there is a relationship between the serotype of a rhinovirus and the molecular structure of the drugs which inactivate it. Indeed one can think of these molecules as probes for the hydrophobic interior of the virus particle, just as monoclonal antibodies are probes for its surface. The group of M. Rossmann at Purdue University have now defined the site at which R61837 binds to the virus capsid and find it to be very similar to the site used by disoxarih this may make it possible to improve chemical structures by reasoned choice rather than by trial and error (Chapman et al., 1991) . Rhinoviruses are very variable antigenically and it appears that they also vary considerably in sensitivity to the most potent antiviral drugs. However, it has been known that they fall into only two groups as judged by their ability to infect cells in tissue cultures, namely those that can infect only human cells (H strains, or major receptor group) or those that can infect both monkey and human cells (M strains or minor receptor group). Several groups have been trying to identify the receptor molecules that are involved in virus entry and are responsible for this specificity. A receptor molecule for the major group has now been identified and purified (Tomassini and Colonno, 1976 ) and recently has been cloned and sequenced by three groups and identified as ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-l) (e.g. Staunton et al., 1989) which was previously known as a surface component of many cells including endothelium, is involved in interactions with lymphocytes, and is expressed in response to various cytokines including IFNT. Antibodies against ICAM-1 inhibit virus growth. Thus antibodies or other molecules that bind to virus or soluble ICAM-1 might be used to prevent and treat infections with major receptor group rhinoviruses. There will no doubt be vigorous research to find useful products of this type and also corresponding blockers for minor receptor group infections. It is common practice to refer to widely used folk -or OTC -remedies for colds as 'symptomatic' and to mean this pejoratively. However, this seems to me to be unfair. It would be ideal to treat the infection by attacking the infectious agent, but it would be practical to commence this treatment only after symptoms and signs have developed. Such treatment might prevent the virus leading to more widespread disease, but this is uncommon and nasal symptoms will only subside gradually even if the infection is 'stopped in its tracks'. It is therefore arguable that in the case of infections like coronavirus or rhinovirus colds, which are normally quickly self-limited, the best approach would be to relieve the patient's discomfort and disability and leave their immune system to take care of the virus. Furthermore in the case of viral and bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract, most of those that lead to diarrhoea are best handled by managing their physiological effects, usually by oral rehydration, while the immune system controls the infection. The trouble is that we know relatively little about the way in which the nose responds to these infections, and therefore use rough measures to control the symptoms, e.g. administering a general adrenergic stimulator to reverse the vasodilation in the nasal mucosa. We know, however, that antihistamines prevent specifically the symptoms of hay fever and allergic rhinitis because histamine is a key mediator in the pathogenic chain of these diseases. We do not have equally precise information for colds. Rather low amounts of leukotrines, prostaglandins and histamine have been found in nasal secretions in colds (Callow et al., 1988) and blocking cholinergic transmission has limited effect on cold symptoms (Gaffey et al., 1988) . On the other hand an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation, which impedes mediator release, has some beneficial effect on colds -even though this has not been proved to be due to an effect on mediators (Barrow et al., 1990a) . It is important to do such studies carefully and objectively -for menthol which has long been used because it relieves the symptoms of nasal obstruction apparently does so by blocking the sensory pathway from the nose and leaving the patency of the airway unchanged. Methods are available to measure blood flow, mucosal temperature as well as patency and nasal secretion but these are only occasionally used to document the effects of virus infection on the nose (Bende et al., 1989) or the anticipated benefits of treatment. However, it has recently been shown that bradykinin, which can induce the symptoms of nasal irritation and discharge, is found in raised concentrations in the nasal secretions of individuals with rhinovirus colds (Naclerio et al., 1987; Proud et al., 1990) . As antikinins are now being developed it is reasonable to investigate whether these relieve the symptoms and signs of a cold, but an initial study of one candidate, NPC 567, has been unsuccessful (Higgins et al., 1991) . While it is attractive to approach the problem with specific hypotheses and specific probes it is also worth exploring less well-defined approaches to modifying the host response. In this area recent studies have shown that steroid treatment delays the clinical response in experimental colds (Farr et al., 1990) , and that local hyperthermia (inhaling water-saturated air at 43°C) has an immediate effect in improving symptoms but also a lesser effect that lasts a few days . It would be interesting to determine what changes glucocorticoids or heat induce in the nasal mucosa and try to identify those that are associated with reduced symptoms. It is possible that 'stressing' nasal cells by hyperthermia turns on the so-called heat shock proteins and modifies the tissue response to infection. In the early days of the Unit, some thought that antiviral treatment was intrinsically impossible, and others that it would be impractical because of the limitations to its use; for instance that it would need to be given prophylactically, or would have to be given intranasally. Nevertheless it is interesting that members of the first group of drugs shown to be effective against respiratory viruses in man, namely amantadine and its successors, are active when given therapeutically and by mouth. This seems to be because they have very advantageous pharrnacokinetics -they are well-absorbed and secreted actively into the respiratory tract (e.g. A1-Nakib et al., 1986) . On the other hand the particle-binding antirhinovirus drugs are very hydrophobic, which is probably the reason for their effectiveness, but it may also explain why they are not secreted with the mucus. As a result such molecules have to be given locally and the schedules of drug administration have to be quite demanding in order to keep the drug concentration high enough -they do not induce a long-lasting change like the antiviral state produced by interferon once it has attached to a cell. This indicates that antirhinovirus drugs with better pharmacokinetics, drug distribution and other properties might be more satisfactory clinically. Even though better molecules are not yet available, it might still be possible to improve their performance by improving the formulation. In fact, in retrospect, the studies of dichloroflavan, the Roche chalcone and R61837 were not directly comparable, because although the dosage regimes, the challenge virus and the methods of observation were the same the drugs were formulated in different ways -in particular the Janssen drug formulation, in a cyclodextran, was distinctly and probably significantly different from that used in the earlier studies. It is probable that individual molecules of drug were located in the hydrophobic interior of what was externally a hydrophilic molecule. Thus it was more nearly in aqueous solution than the solution in oil or the micronized suspension of the other drugs. Other methods of drug presentation are now being developed, for instance by incorporating them into small spheres of polymer which can both provide delayed release and have bioadhesive properties. This type of formulation made it possible to give insulin intranasally to rats and obtain sufficient absorption to have a significant metabolic effect. This essay has focussed mainly on rhinoviruses, as the main cause of common colds. However, we know that coronaviruses as well as paramyxoviruses or enteroviruses also make a small but significant contribution, and there is a substantial fraction due to as yet unidentified organisms (Larson et al., 1980) . This means that even if a highly effective specific rhinovirus treatment were developed it would provide no benefit for many colds. Nevertheless the human coronaviruses are now being explored at the molecular level, and infection with one serotype can already be diagnosed by the use of a nucleic acid probe (Myint et al., 1990) . For this reason we should keep our options open and be prepared to study not only the antimediator treatments mentioned above but also ill-understood empirical treatments, such as local zinc treatment or nasal hyperthermia, both of which were presented originally as antiviral treatments. The former was administered as oral lozenges and seemed to produce some symptomatic benefit but had no effect on the virus infection in studies at our Unit; but good studies done elsewhere, using a slightly different virus and experimental design, showed no benefit. Local hyperthermia with air at 43°C and 100% relative humidity was originally suggested as a way to inhibit the replication of rhinoviruses. In a study in volunteers no inhibition was detected but in a study in general practice it seemed to produce symptomatic improvement as mentioned above. It is probably too much to hope for a~ antiviral that will attack all viruses, but a programme to search for an anticoronavirus drug might be well worth undertaking. Such a search might become more rational than in the past. Perhaps a specific binding site might be found in an essential virus protein, just as had been done for rhinoviruses. Molecular techniques can now be used for rhinovirus detection, such as oligonucleotide probes for conserved regions of the 5' non-coding region and now amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Gama et al., 1989) . Antibodies can be followed very sensitively and specifically by the use of ELISAs (e.g. Barclay et al., 1989) . The host response can also be assessed by clinical and physiological methods. Tests of human performance enable us to assess the 'systemic' effects of the infection and the benefits of any treatment on this (Smith et al., 1988a) . All this technology will enhance the detail in which the clinical study of drug effects can be documented, but unless or until an effective animal model can be developed it is my belief that experiments in human volunteers will continue to play a key part in the development of specific antiviral therapies. This essay is expanded from a talk which was frankly a personal assessment of recent research work done at the Unit on antivirals against common colds. It is, I am afraid, neither a complete history of common cold research in volunteers nor a full review of the results of recent work on anti-rhinovirus drugs. It certainly does not have the literary panache of one of the modern bioessayists. I hope it will be read and assessed for what it is, general views elicited from a jobbing biologist, who regards himself as very fortunate to have been paid to spend his working life in a fascinating

       "Every year around 2-3 million Muslims from over 180 countries arrive in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for a pilgrimage to the holy places of Islam [1] . The crowded conditions within a confined area in close contact with others leads to a high risk of pilgrims acquiring and spreading infectious diseases during their time in Saudi Arabia [2] . Respiratory tract infections are the most common infections affecting pilgrims [3] , and the``Hajj cough'' is considered by pilgrims almost de rigueur [4] . Attack rates of respiratory symptoms of about 50-90% have been recorded among pilgrims from various nationalities [5] [6] [7] . Early reports from the 1978 Hajj season indicated that upper tract respiratory infections already formed the bulk of the work-load of medical teams attending pilgrims [8] . Recent data indicate that 60% of ill pilgrims consulting at Mina primary health structures suffer respiratory tract infections [9] . Respiratory tract infection is the leading cause of hospitalization in Saudi Hospitals during the Hajj, up to 57% in one study [10] . Pneumonia accounts for 30-40% of hospitalizations in tertiary care structures [10, 11] and for 27% of admission in intensive care units where they are responsible for 55% of sepsis [12, 13] during the Hajj. To better characterize the \"Hajj cough\" symptoms and its outcome, this study provides a clinical description of respiratory symptoms experienced by a cohort of French Hajj pilgrims during three consecutive Hajj seasons. Pilgrims who planned to take part in the Hajj were recruited from 2012 through 2014 from a private specialized travel agency in the city of Marseille, which organizes travel to Mecca. Participants were asked to participate in the study on a voluntary basis if they were 18 years of age or older and were able to provide consent. Upon inclusion, the participants were interviewed by Arabicspeaking investigators using a standardized pre-travel questionnaire that collected information on demographics and medical history. A post-travel questionnaire, that collected clinical data, vaccination status, and compliance with preventive measures, was completed during a face-to-face interview just prior to the departure for France. Health problems that occurred during the pilgrims' stay were recorded by a medical doctor who traveled with them. Subjective fever was defined as the pilgrim's report of feeling feverish. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was defined according to the presence of the triad of a cough, sore throat, and subjective fever [14] . The protocol was approved by our Institutional Review Board. It was performed in accordance with the good clinical practices recommended by the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. All participants gave written informed consent. The Pearson's Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, were applied to analyze the categorical variables. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software package version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). P values of 0.05 or less were considered significant. A total of 382 pilgrims were included over three years (96.5% participation rate) with a sex ratio M/F of 0.61 and a mean age of 60.6 years (range 22-85 years). Thirty-nine point three percent of pilgrims were aged 65 years and over. The majority was born in various countries in North Africa (91.6%) and most of them were first-time pilgrims to the Hajj (73.6%). A chronic disease was noted in 55.1%, including hypertension (30.2%), diabetes (27.5%), chronic cardiac disease (8.4%), chronic respiratory disease (7.6%), immune deficiency (1.3%) and chronic renal disease (0.3%). Thirty-one point six percent of pilgrims declared having received the influenza vaccination in 2012 before participating in the Hajj; however none received the vaccine in 2013 and 2014 as it had not been made available in France before the departure dates. 45.8% of participants reported receiving the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination (PPSV23; Pneumo 23 s ) in the past 5 years before participating in the Hajj. Fifty-three point seven percent used face masks during the Hajj, 41.6% washed their hands more frequently than usual, 56.0% used hand sanitizer and 93.4% used disposable tissues. The prevalence of cough was 80.9% (ranging from 69.8% in 2014 to 86.8% in 2013). Symptoms are depicted in Fig. 1 . Dry cough was reported by 59.6% pilgrims and productive cough by 63.8%. Among pilgrims with cough (n ¼ 309) a high proportion presented with associated sore throat (91.0%), rhinitis (78.7%) and voice failure (63.0%). A proportion of 48.3% reported myalgia and 47.3% subjective fever. Forty-six point 2 percent of pilgrims had ILI. Pilgrims with cough had associated dyspnea in 21.0% of cases; gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequently associated including diarrhea (10.0%), nausea (7.9%) and vomiting (4.2%). 11.4% of pilgrims with cough had associated conjunctivitis. The incubation time of respiratory symptoms among pilgrims with Hajj cough was 7.7 days (range 0-25 days) with the majority of pilgrims having onset of symptoms during the first week of stay (58.5%) (Fig. 2) . 51.9% of pilgrims presenting with cough during their stay were still symptomatic at the end of their sojourn. Among pilgrims with cough, 69.4% took antibiotics and two (0.7%) were hospitalized. The prevalence of cough was significantly higher (p ¼ 0.005) among females than men (85.3% vs 73.6%, respectively). Age and chronic conditions had no significant association with the prevalence of cough, pilgrims with chronic respiratory disease showed a slightly increased prevalence of cough. None of the preventive measures were effective in reducing cough prevalence with the exception of influenza vaccine, but the effect was not statistically significant (Table 1) . Our study has some limitations. First it was only conducted among French pilgrims and included a relatively small number of individuals so that our results cannot be extrapolated to all Hajj pilgrims. Second, our clinical description was only based on functional symptoms reported by pilgrims through a questionnaire. It is thus lacking information on clinical signs that could have resulted from physical examination and bias recall may have influenced our results. Nevertheless, we believe that this study provides a useful basic description of the \"Hajj cough\" which may guide health providers when preparing Hajj pilgrims. Our survey shows that the \"Hajj cough\" affected a very high proportion of French pilgrims with an attack rate culminating to 86.8% in 2013. The onset of symptoms was rapid following arrival in Saudi Arabia and persistent symptoms were observed in one out of two pilgrims despite extensive use of antibiotics. The \"Hajj cough\" affected all individuals independently on their age, comorbidities, vaccination status and use of individual non-pharmaceutical preventive measures against respiratory tract infections. Female were more likely than men to suffer Hajj cough and we have no explanation for this observation. Fortunately, the disease was mild with a low rate of hospitalization and complications. Microbiological studies based on PCR detection in respiratory samples were conducted among same cohorts of French pilgrims in the years 2012 and 2013 before departing from France and just prior to leaving Saudi Arabia [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . We observed a high rate of acquisition of viruses, notably rhinovirus, coronavirus E229 and, influenza virus A (H3N2) to a less extent and of Streptococcus pneumoniae. A large study based on the same protocol was conducted in 2013 among pilgrims from different nationalities and confirmed these results. It also showed a significant acquisition of Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae [21] . Sampling at the time of symptoms was conducted in a small subset of French pilgrims in 2012 only and included a restrictive panel of pathogens so that no strong conclusions can be drawn on the role of the respective microbes in the pathogeneses of the \"Hajj cough\". Nevertheless, both clinical and microbiological data indicate that transmission of respiratory pathogens in the context of the Hajj is highly frequent, which is likely the result of overcrowding with a density of 6-8 people per square meter close in certain areas in the Grand Mosque [22] . It is also likely that housing conditions in large collective tents at Mina encampment play a role in the transmission of respiratory viruses [23] . Finally, air pollutants may play a role through their irritant effect since an increase of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and tropospheric ozone levels is observed during Hajj compared to non-Hajj periods [24] . Physicians must be alert to the circulation of common pathogens at the Hajj, which silently cause much more casualties than the newcomer like Middle-East Respiratory syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus which occupy the forefront of the stage and get all the headlines, despite only 8 Umrah-associated MERS cases over an estimated 20 million pilgrims who visited Mecca from 2012 through 2014 [25, 26] . At the moment, none of the usual preventive measures against respiratory tract infection have been proven effective, including vaccination against influenza which is recommended for all Hajj pilgrims by French authorities and vaccination against pneumococcal infections which is recommended for at risk pilgrims suffering chronic conditions and or for those aged 60 years and over [27] . The \"Hajj cough\" seems therefore inevitable and self-treatment should be provided to pilgrims at pre-travel advice. We suggest symptomatic treatment, using cough suppressants such as dextromethorphan, decongestants to relieve nasal congestion such as phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine, with careful use among patients with hypertension, and paracetamol for symptomatic treatment of fever, myalgia and sore throat. The use of antibiotics is questionable since the respective causality of bacteria and viruses in the pathogenesis of the \"Hajj cough\" is not fully established. Nevertheless, prescription of antibiotics to Hajj pilgrims suffering mild respiratory symptoms is frequent in local health care structures: 95-99% patients consulting at the Ear, Nose and Throat clinic of a Hospital in Mecca were prescribed antibiotics while 85-92% presented with upper tract respiratory infection including pharyngitis and tonsillitis [28, 29] . Similarly, patients consulting at various primary health care centers in Mina found that 54% patients were prescribed antibiotics while 61% suffered respiratory tract infection with pharyngitis and the common cold the most frequent [9] . A cohort survey conducted among Iranian pilgrims in 2007 showed that 84% experienced respiratory symptoms and that 72% took antibiotics [30] . In a cohort survey conducted among Indonesian pilgrims, 63% suffered ILI during their stay in the KSA, of which 94% took antibiotics that were mostly obtained over the counter [31] . A recent cohort survey showed that 35% pilgrims from Australia used antibiotics during their stay, the main reason being upper respiratory tract infection. Thirty percent obtained antibiotics from a local pharmacy without prescription and 48% pre-emptively carried an antibiotic with them from Australia [32] . The apparent overall overuse of antibiotics by pilgrims is of concern with regards to the development of drug resistance. In this context, the development of pointof-care diagnostic tests would further enhance the ability to differentiate bacterial from viral infections and so decrease antibiotic use [33] . The Hajj cough is highly common, likely a result of crowded conditions at religious places. It affects all individuals independently of their age, comorbidities, vaccination status and use of classical, individual, non-pharmaceutical preventive measures against respiratory tract infections including hand hygiene, use of face mask use and social distancing which effectiveness at the Hajj has been poorly investigated [34] . Clinical symptoms are non severe, with few hospitalizations necessary and symptomatic treatment should be prescribed with attempts to reduce antibiotic use in non-severe low-risk cases, unless there

       "The interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) 1, 2, and 3 are upregulated upon stimulation of cells by type I IFNs [1, 2] , and these proteins subsequently block membrane fusion between virus and host membranes [3] [4] [5] . IFITM cDNAs were among the first IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) to be cloned and sequenced in the early 1980s [6] . However, the ability of IFITM3 to inhibit virus infections was not demonstrated until 2009 when researchers performing a genome-wide siRNA screen for influenza virus host dependency factors conversely discovered that IFITM3 knock-down resulted in increased influenza virus infection of cells [1] . Confirmatory reports were quickly published by several groups in which other screening studies converged upon the importance of IFITMs, and particularly IFITM3, in innate antiviral defense [2, [7] [8] [9] . Overexpressed IFITM3 potently inhibits influenza virus infection, and IFITM3 KO cells are highly susceptible to infection [1, 3, [10] [11] [12] [13] . Remarkably, IFITM3 KO cells remain highly susceptible to influenza virus infection even after IFN treatments that make WT cells refractory to infection [13] . This in vitro work established that IFITM3 is an essential ISG for cellular defense against influenza virus and, further, that endogenous IFITMs 1 and 2, despite similar antiviral activities to IFITM3 when overexpressed [14] , cannot compensate for loss of IFITM3. IFITM3 is a 15-kDa membrane-associated protein that localizes primarily to endosomes and lysosomes. Evolutionary analysis indicates that an IFITM gene was acquired via horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to a single-celled mammalian ancestor [15] . Though the function of IFITMs in bacteria is entirely unexplored, expression of mycobacterial IFITMs in human cells provided mild resistance to influenza virus infection, suggesting that acquisition of an IFITM gene may have provided an evolutionary advantage against virus infections [16] . IFITM gene duplications are commonly observed in mammalian species [15, 17] and have been proposed to provide increased antiviral coverage of cell membranes by maintaining a highly conserved antiviral core amino acid region with divergent N-and C-termini that dictate protein localization and interactions [18] . Indeed, among the long list of viruses that have now been shown to be restricted by IFITM3, a commonality has emerged in that their membrane fusion reactions generally occur in endosomes where IFITM3 is most abundant [19, 20] . IFITM variants that show altered localization may restrict membrane fusion of a distinct subset of viruses, such as those that fuse at the plasma membrane [18, 21, 22] . The study of posttranslational modifications of IFITM3 has provided numerous insights into its cellular trafficking, turnover/stability, and mechanism of action [23] . IFITM3 undergoes at least four distinct modifications on multiple amino acid residues (Fig. 1) . (1) Phosphorylation at the IFITM3 N-terminal region on Y20 blocks the interaction of a YxxΦΦ trafficking motif (20-YEML-23 in human IFITM3) with the AP-2 endocytic adaptor protein complex that normally facilitates endocytosis of IFITM3 from the plasma membrane to endosomes and lysosomes ( Fig. 1) [21, 24, 25] . Y20 phosphorylation is mediated by the Src family kinase Fyn and results in accumulation of IFITM3 at the plasma membrane and decreased antiviral activity against viruses, such as influenza virus, that enter cells through endocytosis and fuse with endosomes [24, 25] . While phosphorylation may decrease IFITM3 activity against influenza virus, the altered localization enhances its ability to restrict certain viruses that fuse at the plasma membrane as mentioned above [18, 21, 22] . Phosphorylation of IFITM3 is dynamic, involving currently unidentified phosphatases [24, 25] . Though its study led to a better understanding of IFITM3 trafficking, the relevant physiological triggers of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation remain to be identified. (2) Monomethylation of IFITM3 at K88 by the SET7 methyltransferase decreases its antiviral activity [26] . This methylation can also be removed by the histone demethylase LSD1, which is recruited to IFITM3 during IFN treatment of cells [27] . Additional studies will be required to determine the molecular mechanism by which K88 methylation inhibits IFITM3 and whether this inhibition is beneficial to cells. (3) Ubiquitination of IFITM3 can occur on each of four lysines within IFITM3 (K24, K83, K88, and K104) [11] and is primarily mediated by interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 via a conserved PPxY motif in IFITM3 (17-PPNY-20 in human IFITM3) ( Fig. 1) [28]. Mutation of the IFITM3 ubiquitination sites or depletion of NEDD4 from cells results in increased stability of IFITM3 [11, 28] . As such, NEDD4 KO cells accumulate high levels of basal IFITM3 even in the absence of IFN stimulation and are thus resistant to infection with IFITM3-sensitive viruses [22, 28] . It is unknown whether IFITM3 is deubiquitinated in cells, and like methylation, it is also unclear whether the negative regulation of IFITM3 via ubiquitination is beneficial to cells given that these modifications limit the antiviral function of IFITM3. (4) S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 occurs on three highly conserved cysteine residues (C71, C72, and C105) and is the only modification discovered to date that is required for robust IFITM3 antiviral activity [2, 11, [29] [30] [31] . This lipid modification is constitutively added to IFITM3 in an irreversible manner [11] by at least three cellular palmitoyltransferase enzymes (ZDHHC3, ZDHHC7, and ZDHHC20) [13] . Nearly 100% of IFITM3 is palmitoylated on at least one cysteine, and examination of antiviral activity of IFITM3 mutants lacking specific cysteines suggests that C72 is particularly critical for inhibition of influenza virus infection [32] . The primary function of S-palmitoylation at C72 and the neighboring C71 is likely the targeting or anchoring of a highly conserved amphipathic helix (59-VWSLFNTLFM-68 in human IFITM3) that is required for inhibition of membrane fusion by IFITM3 and that is adjacent to these S-palmitoylation sites in the IFITM3 amino acid sequence ( Fig. 1  The primary mechanism by which IFITM3 inhibits virus infection is via blockade of fusion pore formation between virus and host membranes [3, 5] . This prevents the entry of viral genomes into the cytosol and subsequent virus replication. Single particle imaging of fluorescently labeled viruses has revealed that hemifusion between virus and host membranes occurs in cells expressing IFITM3, but that the fusion process is stalled prior to formation of a membrane pore [4] . Insertion of the aforementioned IFITM3 S-palmitoylated amphipathic helix into the cytoplasm-facing leaflet of the host membrane bilayer has been proposed to stabilize a membrane intermediate of the fusion process, consistent with the well-characterized ability of amphipathic helices to induce or stabilize membrane curvature [33•]. The inhibition of fusion of incoming virus requires that IFITM3 is induced and present at inhibitory levels in the target cells. However, IFITMs may have additional functions subsequent to initial infection [34] . Groups studying HIV infections first showed that IFITMs induced in infected cells are incorporated into the membrane envelopes of nascent virions and that this presence of IFITMs limits virion infectivity [35, 36] . This effect was subsequently shown for numerous additional viruses and appears to be a wide-ranging additional function of IFITMs, including IFITM3 [37] . IFITMs in virions likely impair fusogenicity of the viruses, and this likely also involves the conserved amphipathic helix. Additional experiments are required to determine precisely how IFITM3 affects membrane fusion dynamics, and such experiments will not only be informative as to the mechanisms of action of IFITM3, but will also shed light on the fundamental fusion mechanisms used by enveloped viruses. IFITM3 KO mice were initially generated to study a suspected role of IFITM3 in germ cell development in vivo [38] . However, neither IFITM3 KO mice nor mice lacking the entire IFITM locus (referred to as IFITMdel mice in the literature) possessed a defect in germ cells or reproduction [38] . Upon discovery of the antiviral activity of IFITM3 in vitro, these mice were re-examined for phenotypes during microbial infections (Table 1 ). IFITM3 KO mice were observed in two studies to experience increased weight loss and mortality from H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A virus infections, correlating with increased virus lung titers, systemic lymphopenia, and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the lungs [39, 40] . Remarkably, IFITMdel mice did not experience more severe infections than IFITM3 KO mice, suggesting that other IFITMs do not contribute significantly to influenza virus resistance in vivo [40] . In addition to the role of IFITM3 in the innate immune response, it also protects lung dendritic cells from productive infection with influenza virus, thus allowing their trafficking to draining lymph nodes and priming of CD8 T cells [46] . IFITM3 also protects resident memory CD8 T cells from infection and death in the lung during secondary influenza virus infections [47] . Thus, the importance of IFITM3 in primary and secondary influenza virus infections is multifactorial. Additional viruses that show susceptibility to IFITM3 inhibition in vitro have also been examined in IFITM3 KO mice. Chikungunya virus infection in the footpad caused increased ankle joint swelling in IFITM3 KO versus WT mice, correlating with increased virus burden in the serum, spleen, and ankle early in infection [41•] . Similarly, IFITM3 KO mice experienced increased lethality upon footpad infection with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus that was accompanied by increased virus titers in the spleen, liver, spinal cord, and, most significantly, brain [41•] . Together, these experiments demonstrate that IFITM3 is essential for limiting the severity of alphavirus infections in vivo. Several flaviviruses, such as Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, and hepatitis C virus, are also inhibited by IFITM3 in cell culture models [1, [48] [49] [50] [51] . In vivo, subcutaneous infection with West Nile virus induced increased lethality in IFITM3 KO mice compared to that in WT mice [42] . This enhanced pathogenicity correlated with increased virus titers in the serum, lymph node, brain, and spinal cord. Using bone marrow reconstitutions, it was determined that IFITM3 plays essential roles in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells to restrict West Nile virus infection severity. Interestingly, unlike subcutaneous infection, intracranial infection did not result in significant differences in virus burden in the brain or spinal cord, suggesting that IFITM3 does not directly inhibit West Nile virus in the central nervous system [42] . IFITM3 KO mice also showed modest weight loss during respiratory syncytial virus infection that was absent in WT mice [45] , consistent with effects of IFITM3 on this virus in vitro [44] . This weight loss correlated with increased levels of virus in the lungs and increased lymphocyte counts in lung tissue and lung lavage fluid of KO mice [45] . In general, mice are considered a poor model for respiratory syncytial virus infection since high doses of virus are required to achieve measurable infection of lung cells and since weight loss indicative of illness is not usually observed. The small amount of weight loss observed in IFITM3 KO mice suggests that IFITM3 may contribute to respiratory syncytial virus susceptibility in vivo [45] , but its loss does not overcome the significant species restriction barrier for this virus in mice. IFITM3 may also provide a protective effect in certain infections independent of its inhibition of virus entry into cells. Examination of cytomegalovirus infection of several cell types in vitro indicated that this virus is not restricted by IFITM3 [43•] . However, IFITM3 KO mice experience more severe weight loss and increased mortality compared to WT mice following intraperitoneal cytomegalovirus infection [43•] . These effects correlated with a general lymphopenia in circulation and in the spleens of KO mice early in infection. Virus burden and IL-6, TNF, and IFNα were concurrently increased in these spleen homogenates. Stimulation of IFITM3 KO dendritic cells in vitro with irradiated cytomegalovirus or Tolllike receptor ligands resulted in increased secretion of IL-6 compared to that of WT cells. Further, treatment of infected WT or KO mice with anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies caused a reduction in weight loss during infection and also restored NK cells to WT levels in the KO mice [43•] . Interestingly, IL-6 was also among the cytokines increased in the lungs of influenza virus-infected IFITM3 KO mice [39] . Overall, these results suggest that IFITM3 may possess a mechanistically uncharacterized ability to dampen IL-6 production [43•] and also that IFITM3 may play underappreciated roles in preventing cytokine-driven immunopathologies, even in infections that are not directly restricted by IFITM3. The well-defined ability of IFITM3 to prevent infection of cells by influenza virus, along with the increased virus-induced morbidity and mortality of IFITM3 KO mice, has prompted numerous research groups to examine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human IFITM3 gene associate with influenza virus infections or infection severity (all studies to date are summarized in Table 2 ). The pioneering study in this field sequenced the IFITM3 gene regions of 53 patients hospitalized with severe 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza A virus infection [39] . Three of these patients were homozygous for a SNP, rs12252-C, where the T majority allele is substituted with a C. Three out of 53 was a significant overrepresentation of the C allele as compared to matched European controls from 1000 genomes in which the SNP is rare. The authors of this study hypothesized that the C substitution alters a splice acceptor site, resulting in a truncated IFITM3 protein lacking its first 21 amino acids. Overexpression of the truncated IFITM3 variant provided less inhibition of influenza virus as compared to WT IFITM3 [39] , and subsequent studies demonstrated that this mutant is mislocalized due to loss of its YxxΦ endocytosis motif as discussed above [18, 21, 24, 25] . While altered splicing and mislocalization of IFITM3 provided a satisfying mechanistic explanation for effects of the rs12252-C SNP, the existence of truncated IFITM3 protein has not been observed in cells homozygous for the C allele [39, 66•] . Likewise, studies in which RNA sequencing was performed reported that the predicted alternatively spliced transcripts were not detected in cells from individuals homozygous for the C allele [58, 66•] . Thus, whether there is a direct effect of rs12252-C on IFITM3 function or influenza virus infections remains unclear. Several follow-up studies examining Europeans and other populations in which rs12252-C is rare have failed to find an association between the SNP and severe influenza virus infection [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] , although some studies support a link between the SNP and mild influenza [56, 57] . In contrast, a strong overrepresentation of homozygous rs12252-C genotypes in severe influenza patients has been repeatedly observed in studies examining Chinese individuals in which the allele frequency for this SNP is greater than 50% in the general population [52] [53] [54] [55] . This association is consistent between studies examining 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus [53, 55] , H7N9 virus [53, 54] , and seasonal influenza virus [52] infections. Likewise, Chinese individuals who were infected with Hantaan virus and experienced severe hemorrhagic fever were also more likely to be carriers or homozygous for rs12252-C than the general Chinese population [63] . A study examining HIV-infected Chinese individuals also reported that carriage of rs12252-C was more common among rapid progressors with higher viral load set points and a faster decline of CD4 T cells than in those with slower progression of disease [64] . However, results from this study have been cautiously interpreted by the field and will require additional corroboration since rs12252-C homozygous individuals were surprisingly underrepresented among the rapid progressors [64] . In sum, there is generally a strong association between severe influenza virus infections and homozygosity of the IFITM3 rs12252-C SNP in Chinese individuals, while infrequency of the SNP in Europeans makes it difficult to confidently assess its effects in this population (Table 2) . A recent landmark study examined a second IFITM3 SNP located within the IFITM3 gene promoter [65] . A minor allele, rs34481144-A, was associated with severe influenza virus infections in a largely African American population and with death following influenza virus infection in a largely European population [65••] . Additionally, early replication of influenza virus in a third study group made up of individuals of European ancestry was also linked to carriage of this SNP [65••] . In the populations examined, this SNP ranged in allele frequency from 16.9 to 33.25%. Mechanistically, cells from individuals possessing the rs34481144-A SNP showed decreased IFITM3 mRNA and protein levels in a doseresponsive manner, correlating with the presence of one or two rs34481144-A alleles [65••] . This effect on IFITM3 gene expression was suggested to be due to differential occupancy of the IFITM3 promoter by activating versus inhibitory transcription factors [65••] . These intriguing new findings further support the importance of IFITM3 in antiviral defense in vivo, and indeed, SNPs in IFITM3 remain the only reproducibly observed human genetic associations with severe influenza virus infections [67] . We have only begun to understand the importance and functions of IFITM3 in antiviral defense in vivo. For example, only a limited number of the viruses restricted by IFITM3 in vitro have been studied in IFITM3 KO mice and even fewer infections have been examined in humans. To date, studies in humans have primarily focused on influenza virus infections. The discovery of the importance of the rs34481144-A SNP in controlling IFITM3 levels [65••] should facilitate the study of IFITM3 in additional human infections in diverse populations. Additionally, the discovery of a regulatory role for IFITM3 in IL-6 production [43•], along with a recent report that IFITM3 is a negative feedback inhibitor of the type I IFN induction pathway [68] , may suggest that IFITM3 is a broad regulator of inflammation and that it may play important roles in infections in which the balance between pathogen control versus tissue pathology is determined by these cytokines. Interestingly, IFITM3 KO mice were not observed to be more susceptible to infections with Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter rodentium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or Plasmodium berghei [45] (Table 1) . Thus, at present, the critical role of IFITM3 in antimicrobial defense appears to be limited to virus infections, though this remains an open question. Given the strong and reproducible association between homozygosity of the IFITM3 rs12252-C SNP and severe influenza in the Chinese population, it will be important to determine the underlying mechanism by which this SNP influences disease. The initially proposed hypothesis that the SNP affects splicing [39] has not been supported by subsequent studies [58, 66•] . Whether rs12252-C influences IFITM3 gene splicing or protein levels in a cell type-specific manner and whether this SNP cosegregates with a different causative allele both remain unknown. The antiviral effects of IFITM3 are reversed by the membrane-destabilizing drug amphotericin B, which is commonly prescribed to treat fungal infections in humans [69] . Mice treated with amphotericin B experience more severe influenza virus infections, similar to IFITM3 KO mice [69] . We recently determined that IFITM3 is the first known restriction factor for human metapneumovirus infection, and we confirmed that amphotericin B completely neutralizes the antiviral activity of IFITM3 against both influenza virus and human metapneumovirus [22] . Thus, it will be interesting and important to determine whether clinical use of amphotericin B has the unintended consequence of increasing susceptibility to or pathogenicity of these and other virus infections due to its neutralizing effects on IFITM3. Antiviral restriction factors often drive the evolution of viruses to evade or inhibit virus restriction [70] . IFITM3 inhibits the membrane fusion of influenza virus, which is typically triggered by low pH in endosomes [3] [4] [5] . Given that endocytosis and membrane fusion are fundamental steps in the entry of all influenza viruses, all strains of the virus that have been tested to date are susceptible to IFITM3 restriction to varying degrees. The degree of susceptibility appears to be determined by the pH optimum at which the virus fuses. Viruses that fuse at low pH in late endosomes where IFITM3 is abundant are strongly restricted [71, 72] . Conversely, viruses that have evolved to fuse at a higher pH in early endosomes where IFITM3 is less abundant are partially resistant to IFITM3 restriction [71, 72] . Similarly, in vitro studies of HIV have shown that over time in culture the HIV env protein will evolve to evade restriction of the virus by IFITMs [73] . Lack of restriction by IFITMs is indeed a characteristic of transmitted founder HIV isolates derived from recently infected humans [74••, 75] . Interestingly, as HIV evolves its env protein in vivo to evade adaptive immune responses, restriction by IFITMs increases [74••, 75] . The on-going evolutionary battle between viruses and IFITMs will be an exciting area for further investigation. Several broad conclusions can be drawn from the research performed on IFITM3 over the past decade. First, IFITM3 is a broad inhibitor of membrane fusion between viruses and cell membranes and is particularly active against viruses that enter cells via endocytosis due to its primary localization at endosomes. Second, IFITM3 utilizes an amphipathic helix to block virus membrane fusion. Third, IFITM3 is regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications that determine its intracellular localization, activity, and abundance. Fourth, IFITM3 knockout mice experience increased susceptibility to a wide range of virus infections. Fifth, IFITM3 gene SNPs in the human population are correlated with severe virus infections. The continued study of IFITM3 and other IFITMs in terms of their precise mechanisms of action, their range of microbial restriction in vivo, effects of human SNPs, and possible viral countermeasures will continue to increase our understanding of virus-host interactions.
